I am sending you links to our newest ASAP's on California wage and hour and
workers compensation issues.  Our ASAP's are our summary of important
developments in employment law.  If you do not have employees in California,
these ASAP's probably are not relevant to your company.

The first ASAP summarizes recent developments relating to whether or not
computer professionals and nurses must be paid overtime.  The link to this
ASAP follows:

http://128.241.163.162/nwsltr/asap_sb88.html

The second ASAP is a general overview of the current state of the workers'
compensation system in California.  This may even be of interest if you do
not have employees in California because the issues that arise in California
often occur in other parts of the country.  The link to this ASAP follows:

Dave,

Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I 
ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that 
the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon 
we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be 
replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.

Thanks.

Subject: Comments to P&S Agreement -- Triple Lutz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anne,

I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.  From my perspective, it 
generally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add 
any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.

In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I 
believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be 
identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds 
$250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the 
provisions of Section 4.13(iii).

Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not 
required by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the 
future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key 
personnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with 
the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains 
a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.

In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any 
employment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, 
and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands 
and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) 
also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.

In Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that 
we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence 
to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.

In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind 
to customers.  I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host 
client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and 
provide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de 
minimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of 
Ethics may work here.

In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, 
or does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to "cash" 
payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock 
options/restricted stock that vest over time.

In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates 
vesting -- Pat, do you know?

Should Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee 
Matters Agreement.

Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the 
purposes of dispute resolution?

Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any 
other questions.

Michelle

Pat,

I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate 
email.  I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given 
your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.  In terms of 
timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a 
chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!

Thanks a lot!

Michelle

Attached is a mark-up of the PSA with Bidder A, which incorporates most of
the Bidder A's comments.  As discussed, we have attempted to include those
comments proposed by Bidder A when possible and yet preserve the more
important "materiality protections for Seller.   The draft is marked against
Seller's bid document form, however, I have asked Lehman to send to me
electronically the Bidder A form.  Upon receipt, I will prepare and
distribute to you a compare-rite which will show the Bidder A comments which
we didn't accept.  In this draft, please note the following:

1.  Enron should confirm and advise whether the delayed closing date (April
2001) as reflected in Section 3.1 is acceptable.

2.  The tax provisions  include V&E's comments, however Enron Tax personnel
should consider carefully the "after tax basis" concept and definition,
Section 4.9 and Article 11.

3.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the
proper thresholds and amounts for (i) the Deductible Amount, (ii) the
liability cap, (iii) Section 4.13 and Section 6.3.

4.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the
provisions in Section 4.16 (Insurance) including the continuing post-closing
insurance obligations.

5.  The appropriate Enron personnel should advise us regarding the proper
procedures for Buyer to participate (observatory capacity) in the
post-signing business in accordance with Section 7.15.

Once you have had the opportunity to review the attached agreement, please
give me a call to set up a time to discuss your comments and required
revisions.

Subject: Lawyer approval
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Julia,

On Garden State matters, how do you want to handle the signing of documents?  
Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and 
initialling them before signature.  Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may 
be a desire to have a more expeditious process.  

I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department 
is going to be involved in GSP work.  Given our discussion last week, I would 
not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the 
standard Enron process, but it is not my call.

I would appreciate your thoughts.

I asked David Howe about this issue.  He said htat he wants to have an

     Michelle, we terminated Bill Nycz October 12, he is now ready to sign
     the release that Pat McCarthy wrote up.

     Once bill signs this, we will need to get a company signature pretty
     quickly to pay him expeditiously (i would like to cut the check as
     soon as his 7 days are up).  I assume that David Howe needs to sign it
     . . . does David have to have your approval to sign something like
     this?

     When Pat writes contracts for us, do i still need to get you to sign
     off on it before David Howe signs it?  If a management employee of GSP
     who is not an Enron employee signs a contract, do we have to have
     Enron legal approve it?

     Hoyt

Further to our e-mail of last evening forwarding the above report and the 
enclosed hard copies of this report which you will have received by courier 
this morning, enclosed for replacement of the existing document at Tab 1 is a 
revised version of our overview memorandum.  At the time of sending our 
document last evening I did not yet have our real estate report.  This 
portion of the report has been incorporated.  This document should therefore 
replace the existing document at Tab 1.

Second, enclosed is a more detailed labour/employment due diligence report 
which should replace the existing document at Tab 4 of your binder.

Third, enclosed is a more detailed real estate due diligence report which 
should be placed at Tab 5 of your binder.

Finally, enclosed is a more detailed review of the banking documents and 
security which should be placed at Tab 10.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.

Andrea, in response to Michelle's concerns about legal review of our Affirmative Action Plans, Please consider the following:

Background:   
?	Affirmative Action Plan development is supported by specific software that was implemented in January 2000.  
?	The Plans consist of two primary elements, the narrative portion and the statistical portion. 
?	Narrative was reviewed for legal merit in January 2000 by George Chaffee, Attorney at Law, Littler Mendelson, Walnut Creek, CA and by a local consultant, George Pharis, President, Strategic Direction Resources Inc. 
o	Recommended changes were incorporated into the FY 2000 AAPs.  The narrative section of an AAP is generally the same each year with few changes necessary.
?	The statistical portion requires an intense amount of labor each year.  The database of the plan has to be confirmed for accuracy
?	Plans are reviewed against the previous year's AAP for continuity
?	Once we have drafts of the AAP (narrative and statistical portion) for a business unit:
o	Draft plan and a memo are sent to the business unit HR head for review
o	HR head requests any changes and confirms their buy-in before the plan is finalized and distributed to their organization
o	Execution signatures are obtained
o	Plans are distributed to management level employees to guide their hiring/promotion and termination decisions throughout the course of the plan year.
o	Quarterly utilization reports are completed and sent to the business units to allow them to track their progress achieving AAP goals
o	If a "new goal" is warranted from quarterly reports, it is highlighted for the business unit to consider as they move forward through the rest of the year

Recommendations:

?	02 Plan narratives drafted and reviewed by appropriate legal counsel.  (Complete no later than Y/E 2001)
	o	OFCCP changes to regulations became effective December 13, 2000.  New Regs have reduced some narrative   
            requirements however underlying responsibilities are still implied  
?	AAP Plan drafts provided to HR Head and respective legal counsel for review, change, and approvals before being submitted for execution signatures
?	OLER to revise and communicate new execution milepost to get AAPs completed. Earliest data access date is Jan 15 - (reflecting Y/E promotions, terms etc)  

OLER is committed to supporting an effective AAP process for client units.  Please assist us by sharing you interests and perspectives on the recommendations offered.   

Regards, Rj.

This draft represents the compensation and recovery concerns that Scarth Lyons have as a result of the early termination of 2 prior agreements with Enron development spvs. They loose out when Enron flips a deal and the successor terminates.  Please review and let me know your views on the best way to proceed.  Michelle has agreed that this is "just papering up a deal that is already underway".  Once ready, I'll ask Michelle's support for the execution approval and I will let the commercial team know.  Thanks, Rj.

Michelle,

Thanks for your response. I tried to call you but got to your voice mail
so I am sending you this email to clarify some questions I have.

Please confirm that when you mention the "processing of the ECI
payments" you refer to the actual wire transfers and not to the process
of confirming the amounts based on the ECI-Enron contracts - which I
hope is complete by now.

Also, when you refer to the ECI payments does that mean that the
Employment Agreement payment amounts are still under review? If that is
the case and in the interest of gaining time please proceed with the
payments of the ECI amounts which I take it are simpler to calculate
(they depend on a formula and not on net income calculations like the
Employment Agreement payments) and we can deal with the Employment
Agreement payments later. Obviously if you have performed all the
calculations for both payments I would prefer to receive the entire
amount.

I realize this is a hectic time at Enron but unfortunately these
payments are VERY late and as I described in my previous emails I have
been postponing closing an important transaction which has considerable
value to me for months now. Unless I receive at least the ECI related
payments immediately I will be obliged to unwind other investments which
may be done at a considerable cost to me.

Please let me know if you have all the necessary information for the
wire transfers available to you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Diomedes

Good day, Diomedes,

First, let me say that I am sorry about the delay in responding to your
earlier email.

I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments
has begun!  Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron
over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the
processing.  However, if you have questions about timing, please feel
free to call me at  713-853-6401 or Pam Butler at 713-853-6161.

Feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this matter
further.

Subject: Michael Lindert v. Enron Corp. and EES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vicki,

As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by Michael Lindert against Enron Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 million.

Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.  

I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me). 

The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.

The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to federal court.

Let me know how you want me to proceed.

Michelle

Subject: RE: Revocation:  Signing Bonus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.  Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.

I agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.

Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.

Ya'll let me know if you disagree.

Subject:	Revocation:  Signing Bonus

The initial view on this was that we should not pay signing bonuses when we revoke offers of employment, but I have continued to give thought to the issue and my concerns.  It appears that our offer letters refer to the bonus as a "sign-on bonus" and "signing bonus" and state that it will be paid within 30 days of hire.  The letter does not address what to do if we revoke, or if the applicant revokes.   

I think that based on the "signing" language, applicants could argue that because they signed, we owe signing bonuses.  

On the other hand, signing alone really can't be enough to justify payment; I don't think anyone would buy off on the idea that an applicant could sign, refuse to show up, and still be owed the bonus.  

Balancing those considerations, I think a viable argument can be made that an applicant who signs and professes a willingness to still show up must be paid the promised signing bonus.  As such, I think we have some exposure here.  I can't assess how much, in part because I don't have an estimate of the dollars at issue.  I do, however, understand that we plan to revoke approximately 100 offers, not necessarily all of which will involve signing bonuses. 

Any thoughts?

Lizzette and Ryan,

Kriste and I substantially revised the waiver agreement today, so sit tight.

Kriste, do you want to add the mediation provision?  I'll leave that to you.

Ryan,

I'm sending back down the mark ups to the rif packet you sent to me.  On the waiver, I've scratched out some paragraphs and told you I would send other language.  This is it.  Call with questions.



4.	Employee Benefits.  Except as otherwise provided in Section ___((the paragraph with the dollar amount)), Employee shall be entitled to receive vested or accrued benefits due and payable to Employee under all employee benefit plans and compensation plans, subject to the terms of those plans. 

5.3.	Cooperation.  Employee agrees that, at Company's request, he or she will devote reasonable time necessary to assist in Company's litigation matters, including, but not limited to, meeting with counsel, providing testimony at depositions or trial, and related activities.

To the release paragraph (right after the bolded paragraph saying employee releases everything.... add this section (you may need to organize the sections):

b.	This release does not apply to or include the consideration or benefits described in Section 2 above or to other promises and representations contained in this Agreement.  This release also does not apply to claims which may arise after the date this release is signed. Employee understands that he or she may challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of this release under the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) and the ADEA before a court, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or any state or local agency charged with the enforcement of any discrimination laws, despite the release language stated above. Employee also understands that nothing in this release prevents him or her from filing a charge or complaint with or from participating in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the EEOC or any state or local agency charged with the enforcement of any discrimination laws.  Employee understands, however, that if he or she pursues a claim against Company under the OWBPA and/or the ADEA, Company may seek to set off the amount paid to Employee for signing this release against any award he or she may obtain in such legal proceeding, and Company may be entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees incurred by the Company as specifically authorized under applicable federal or state law.

Also add this:

d.	Employee acknowledges, agrees, and represents to Company that:

(i)	Employee has carefully read and fully understands the effect of the provisions of this Agreement, which he or she is entering knowingly and voluntarily;

(ii)	Employee has had a reasonable time of not less than 45 days in which to consider this Agreement;

(iii)	Employee was advised and encouraged to consult an attorney prior to executing this Agreement with respect to the effect of the provisions of this paragraph and Employee's execution of this Agreement; and

(iv)	Employee acknowledges that he or she has received information concerning the age and job titles of other persons in his or her job classification or organizational unit, if any, who are remaining employed with the Company, as well as the job titles and ages of the persons being offered payments upon voluntary separation.  The voluntary separation applies to the groups, for the time periods, and based on the eligibility factors set forth in the attached Exhibit "A."

	Employee may revoke this Agreement during the seven-day period following the date Employee signs this Agreement by delivering signed, written notice of such revocation to Human Resources and as required under Section __, whereupon this Agreement shall be rescinded in its entirety and become null and void.  


Add this as well: 

7.10	Mediation.  If a dispute arises out of or related to Employee's employment with Company, or this Agreement, and if the dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, then Company and Employee agree to try to settle the dispute in an amicable manner by confidential mediation before having recourse to any other proceeding or forum.


Please send it to me again, and I will help organize as needed and check to see if we need to add any other major provisions.

Subject: Dynegy Request
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

David,

Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this.  

Michelle

Michelle,

It looks like my contacts have added more than one addition to our list of

possible Enron employees.  I am forwarding on this complete list w/ 25 more

possible employees to search.  Can you let us know if these people were

Enron employees and their dates of employment?   Sorry, I didn't send this

list with the request yesterday, but it was not generated at the time of

the request.

Thank you,

Kevin Kosub

Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed.  We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. 
B.  If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

Tim, absolutely.  You have my permission to pass this information on to HR and any member of senior management as I need to fill in the gap she created in my resume, as I am going to require references.  Not only would I like to persuade Pam to put her apology in writing, I've contemplated contacting Joe Sutton to set the record straight as Pam blocked me all three times I requested through HR having a meeting with Joe in the presence of my HR representative and Pam as well.  I think he should also know the truth.

Thank you Tim for your feedback, as I continue to appreciate and value your advice.

Tim, I just wanted to share with you the matter of my having received a telephone call a week ago from Pam Benson (formerly of Joe Sutton's office).  She was the admin with Joe Sutton's office who'd approached me and then insisted I had to come work with her in supporting Joe's office even after I had told HR and her I wasn't interested.

She was also responsible for eliminating me from Joe's office in his absence upon her return from her surgery after I had supported his office  having been complimented by him verbally to Pam in my presence as having taken what he referred to  as "the best planned trip he'd been on in years with everything in place". (This was in reference to his trip around the world when he went to India to meet with President Clinton.)

Pam said she's "had me on her mind for a long time" then proceeded with:
"I was going to call you at home but was uncertain that the number I had was correct, so decided to call you at Enron since I knew you were there." 
"I had to call to tell you I've had you on my mind for a long time and that I need to tell you how very sorry I am for what I did to you, Cindy.  You didn't deserve to be treated like that."  "You are a fine person" and then she broke down crying on the telephone.  Pam said she hoped in her heart I would forgive her and that "she didn't deserve to talk to me".  

She said she had retired and was calling me from her home and that "God had been talking to her and told her to make this telephone call and that she needed to call to apologize to me for what she had done to me." She said twice, "if there is anything I can do for you emotionally or financially, please call me and I will do whatever I can to help you."  My only response to Pam was, "Pam,  I  do not understood why you did it."   

Tim, in all of my years employed within the corporate environment, I have never encountered anyone like Pam Benson before who would harbor jealousy to the point where they would want to destroy a person's reputation among their peers and professional associates and manipulate someone's career.  Of course she caught me off guard calling me here at the office around 11:00 am which left me speechless.  I found her call strange as so much time has passed.  Her disruptive behavior only reflected her thoughts. 

I just thought I'd share this with you.  Some people never cease to amaze me.  

Cindy

	Per my conversation with Britt on Friday, attached is a draft notice
of bankruptcy in the Event case.  I left it very bare, i.e., did not say
whether the bankruptcy stays the adversary proceeding, because we may not
want it "stayed" in light of Rodney Tow's intent to dismiss the proceeding
in favor of an agreed liquidating plan.
	Also, the U.S. trustee filed  a motion to dismiss or convert the
case since it has been inactive and no plan has been confirmed.  I was not
served with the motion, but Rodney told me about it and I have received his
response.  I would like to join with a short response on Enron's behalf, a
draft of which is attached.  The response is due tomorrow (Monday), so let
me know if you have any concerns about filing it.

Hi Michelle,
 
The attached spreadsheet should represent a complete set of developers of EnronOnline since inception.  I haven't named the individual Valtech and Agency.com developers since the agreements we have with those companies presumably cover all of their developers.
 
The rest of the systems will probably not be done until tomorrow.

I don't think so because they roll up under EIM and I don't think they were included.  I'll check my query on who I included in the initial pull I did.  Diane may have included them in the second pass at that data.
