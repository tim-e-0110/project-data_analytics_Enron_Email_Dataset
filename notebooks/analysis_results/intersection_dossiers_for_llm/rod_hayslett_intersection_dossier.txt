--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.  They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.

Bruce and Rob,

This is the latest from AA on what they want to see in an internal and external legal letter on Dabhol.  They now say they need both letters the earlier of 1) when they sign off on the 3rd Qtr 10-Q or 2) December 15, 2001.  Give me a call and we can discuss further.

Sommers
