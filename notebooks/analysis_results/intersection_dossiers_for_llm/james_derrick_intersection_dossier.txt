Subject: Celina Ozorio

Jim: 

Celina Ozorio is a paralegal in the Rio office who has performed very well 
this past year and who we would like recommend for promotion to a junior 
attorney (Attorney I) position.  I have discussed this with both Randy and 
Rob and they support this move.  

Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a year 
ago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of law 
firm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuing 
her professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a 
professional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on more 
responsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hard 
to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.  We 
believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior 
attorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron 
attorney in the future.  As a junior attorney, she would continue to work 
under the supervision of more senior attorneys and would have the opportunity 
to continue her professional development.  

I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that 
it sends the right message to others in the department that there are 
opportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.

Please let me know how you feel about this recommendation and whether you 
think it would be appropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in 
Houston.  Thanks.

Regards,
 John

Wessex's regulatory lawyer, Chris Bright, has just joined Shearman and Sterling from Clifford Chance.  Until late 1998, he was with Linklaters, Wessex's corporate counsel when it was publicly traded.

Jim, does Enron have a good relationship with Shearman and Sterling?  Though I haven't talked with the Wessex folks, I'm sure Wessex would want to continue using Chris--he is really good.

Jim:

Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.

Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.

I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.

- Rob

Rob:

I've attached two documents:

First, an Excel Spreadsheet listing the number of judicial participants by
court and state. We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations.
In many states, the judges are elected in "nonpartisan" elections -- of
course, it is usually pretty clear who is what.  I imagine that there is a
"selection bias" toward more conservative judges -- however, even if there
is such a bias, our programs are still very valuable when in comes to making
our civil justice system more predictable.  Even the pro-business judges
need to understand how to articulate the economic reasoning that supports
their pro-business instincts.  We provide them with the tools to be more
effective.

Second, a generic description of Chapman from their P.R. office.  Rest
assured, the church does not play a major role in the University.

Also, I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman
University and Enron.  The most important player at Chapman is George L.
Argyros.  George is Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a very loyal
financial supporter of the University.  I will be Dean of the George L.
Argyros School of Business and Economics.  George has been nominated by
President Bush as Ambassador to Spain.

George Argyros is also Chairman Emeritus & Treasurer of the Horatio Alger
Association.  Kenneth L. Lay is Executive Vice President of the Horatio
Alger Association.

I suspect that Mr. Argyros and Mr. Lay have worked closely in their
leadership capacities with the Horatio Alger Association.

I would hope that this connection would result in a much larger contribution
to the Chapman LOEC.  Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed?

Checks should be made payable to "Chapman LOEC" and sent to me at the
address below.

Thanks for Enron's support.

Hope all is well with you.

Sincerely,

Henry

				Emilio,

				I think you should proceed.  Could you send me a resume?

				Jim, our two lawyers at Azurix Buenos Aires have needed some assistance in handling routine matters, given that most of Emilio's time is taken up with the termination issues.  The though has been to hire a local lawyer, known to the local team, on a contract basis to help with these items.  There's significant work to help in dealing with pending construction and supply contracts as the concession winds down.  I assume this is OK with you.

				John,
				I met this lawyer that I mentioned to you again, and she seems to be
				ready to manage working for us full-time during a three months period in
				order to help us, mainly with the fixing of contractual issues with our
				suppliers vis a vis termination / tranfer of the contracts to the
				Province / determination of liabilities. The costs would not be high,
				and she seems to be (I hope so) a very discreet person (particularly
				considering the job she currently has). If you do not have a problem
				with this (my only concern is her work at the Municipality), I would ask
				her to start working for us on Monday, not on a labour relationship
				basis, but rather on a independent professional one (she would bill us
				for her services).

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday.

Mike -

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is "preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify".

There are lots of employees wondering if/how they should react to all the class actions being filed, esp. those that are filed with employee plaintiffs and /or relate to benefit plans. It might be helpful to let people know how class actions work, that they don't need to sign up to be lead plaintiffs, that if awards or settlements occur they will have a chance to participate later, will be notified, etc. This might calm people down and avoid a stampede if rumors start flying around that if people don't sign up or join now they will be left out.

Subject:	ENRON EUROPE


Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

Subject:	copying bill


Rex,
 
We  sent up thru Jim's office earlier in the week a bill from the local firm,  Medleh, that has been doing our copying and imaging.  They've told us they  will shut down operations for Enron if they don't get paid.  That will halt  some of our efforts to respond to the SEC subpoena.  Is there some way to  check on where that stands?
 
Joe
