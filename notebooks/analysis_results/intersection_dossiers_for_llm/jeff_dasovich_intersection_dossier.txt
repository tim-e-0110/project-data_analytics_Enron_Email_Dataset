--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK.  Having taken a second look at the spreadsheet I sent yesterday, here's a 
revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's 
#4.  Most significant issue:  the discrepancy between Kim's and mine is that 
Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain 
on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add 
them).  No big deal, we just need to make an assumption and go with it.  
There's a couple of other differences that are identified in the answer to 
#4--again, just need to make the call either way.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Update--Day 3 of California PUC Hearings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.

Greetings and Happy New Year to you both.

Eve:  Has the sub-group met since things were put on hold a few weeks ago?  
If so, I'm very interested in hearing about what's going on.  If the group is 
going to meet between now and the 16th, I'm also very interested in 
participating in those meetings.  Delaney, I'll be attending the meeting on 
the 16th.  The Angelides proposal has certainly spiced things up--just what 
we need, more David Freeman.......

Best to you and yours in the New Year.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Jeff,

Per your request, I am writing a brief note to follow up on our
telephone conversation today.  As we discussed, Enron plans to change
the structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C
corporation to an LLC.  As we discussed previously, this change in
structure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities
Commission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of
the Public Utilities Code.  You indicated that someone inside Enron was
concerned that, during the course of the CPUC,s review of the request
for transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax
returns of ETI,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would
find unattractive.  You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.

At a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over
entities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.  Depending on
the facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this
jurisdiction.  However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look
into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant
telecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking
to acquire control of the carrier.  For nondominant telecommunications
carriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch,
because such carriers have no market power.  You should also be aware
that there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's
financial information from public disclosure.

Thus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review
the books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in
connection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.  ETI is a
nondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of
ETI, because EBS will still be ETI,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC,
rather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management
personnel of ETI.

The one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the
Commission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.  While this
logically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably
trigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.

Please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss
further.

Subject: Summary of Proposed Short-term Solution for California's Energy
 Crisis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dean Tyson:

It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet you 
and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I 
wanted to summarize where we left off at today,s meeting regarding California,
s energy crisis.  That summary is attached.  I've also attached three 
articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolster 
our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meeting.

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy is 
a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, it 
appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that success 
requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.  
The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed that 
all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot. 
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of 
success and is greatly appreciated.  

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made at 
the meeting.  It represents a &first cut,8 it will undoubtedly change as the 
details get worked out, and I,m sure I,ve missed something.  So please don,t 
hesitate to edit the draft.

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal 
internally.  As such, I can,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the 
proposal.  But I,m confident that the company can support something akin to 
this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.

In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has played 
a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and 
analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort as 
well.

Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washington 
D.C. office.  If she can help in any way, please don,t hesitate to let me 
know.  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to 
discuss things further.  My home phone is 415.621.8317.

Best,
Jeff

How about talking Monday pm?

There were a ridiculous amount of handouts again on Thursday, some of which
directly related to next week's assignments.  I thought the quiz was
straight forward enough.

Mark - my mom and I were going to go to the Pottery Barn Kids in Corte
Madera on Saturday, so perhaps we could stop by your house to drop off
copies of the handouts on our way in or out.  Send me directions again to
your house if you would.  

I'm not sure how we can get copies to you Jeff.  I could drop them off to
your place in SF if that works.  Let me know.

Jeff, Mark:

Wondering where you were yesterday. Hope you didn't
forget about the in-class quiz!

The next HW and writeup due next week seems like
a heavy one.
Do most of you have Monday off? I'll take a look at the

Jim:
It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversation, 
this email includes the following:

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lands.

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on how 
to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR,s ability to 
sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two 
possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC 
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through 
rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I 
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and proposed 
amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable 
option.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near- 
and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your 
office tomorrow detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will 
also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our 
proposed language.

I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact me 
if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anything 
else that I can do to assist you.

Regards,
Ken

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a 
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been 
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract 
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit the 
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for 
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce 
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by 
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of 
distributed generation.
 
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with 
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor,s executive order regarding interconnection is a 
step in the right direction*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete 
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this 
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed 
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when 
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome 
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent 
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from the 
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be 
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., &on-site8) generation that is 50 MWs or 
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and 
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale 
generation faces.  

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru 
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant 
output apply equally to smaller scale, &distributed generation8 facilities. 
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to 
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial 
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects.  
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase 
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities 

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with 
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the 
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk 
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion,s share of counterparties share Enron,s credit 
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and 
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to 
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements 
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to 
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our 
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the 
California PUC,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As 
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates 
adequate charges to cover DWR,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract &Prudence8
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public 
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are 
&imprudent.8  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then refuse to 
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power 
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree 
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that 
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
 
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to 
Recover DWR,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority 
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to 
the specific ratemaking &mechanics8 that AB1X directs the PUC to employ to 
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it is 
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure 
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it is 
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in 
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR,s power purchase 
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since 
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover 
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk 

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk 
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the 
PUC would accept as &prudent and reasonable8 all purchase costs incurred by 
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to 
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the 
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political 
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file 
entitled, &AmendAB1X.doc8.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and 
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to 
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly more 
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic 
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC 
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, 
&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.8)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR,s RFP, we are willing to accept 
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit, 
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have 
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR 
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through 
contract amendments.

4. California,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports 
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ 
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All 
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer 
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are 
likely.  

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this 
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our 
estimates.  California,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well 
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operation 
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power 
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the 
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to 
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the 
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply.  
California,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this 
requirement.  

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early 
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's severe 
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced 
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the 
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current 
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be 
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of 
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more 
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000 
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California 
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California,s 
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We will 
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing 
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's 
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.  
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less 
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor,s executive orders and Senator Sher,s siting reform legislation 
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve those 
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face 
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit 
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron,s 
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) 
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an 
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund 
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected air 
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the 
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing 
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the 
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished most 
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund 
to finance DWR,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more 
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would 
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., 
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to 
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To 
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment 
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the 
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, &Deal 
Bench,8 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price 
for hour-ahead power in real time. 
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment 
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be 
paid for load reduction (&Negawatts8).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include:

&creation8 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, particularly 
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation 
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California 
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in 
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk 
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to 
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for 
responding. 

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in 
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for 
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate 
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 times 
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates 
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and 
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market*Legislative vehicle: 
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were 
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy 
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from 
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove the 
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a 
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department of 
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from 
customer migration.  

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when 
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procurement 
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial 
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should 
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement 
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a 
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California 
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in 
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments 
of utility load.

Return California,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency*Legislative vehicle: 
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand.  
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California,s supply-demand 
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers 
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California 
State government assume the role of &electricity buyer8 for an extended 
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence 
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to 
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a 
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate 
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without 
&shocking8 the economy or household budgets For example, California could 
amortize the recovery of the utilities, past debt over a 5-10 year period.  
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways: 
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in 
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 
1890.  Second, California can &net8 the revenues the utilities have received 
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they have 
accrued due to the retail price cap.

Defending Davis/Lynch

Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly 
slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of 
the following events.  In sum:

Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met 
with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom.  
DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 
100%.  (See attached story.)
Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because 
Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, "don't move 8X (a bill that 
Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; 
they need much more." 
It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis 
likes it or not.
The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had 
been informed of the "bombshell." 
Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the 
situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.)
Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they 
won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to 
implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.)
Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in 
which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market 
proponents, price gougers and Texans, and defending Davis and Lynch.

Davis' Measured Plan To Fight the Darkness

D103778.DTL 
COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov. 
Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to 
light a candle than curse the darkness. 
Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme. 
The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed. 
-- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission? 
-- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could 
charge customers? 
-- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to 
sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory 
pricing by out-of-state merchant generators? 
-- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to 
ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity? 
-- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough 
available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and 
demand? 
These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents 
of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to 
bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions. 
The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid, 
though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning 
electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of 
power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason 
Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern 
California had plenty of power. 
The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities, 
pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a 
tangible and valuable asset in exchange. 
And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing 
bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long 
failed at doing. 
The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and 
Davis' actions to enhance these efforts. 
California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The 
governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an 
executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their 
consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial 
lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and 
commercial buildings more energy efficient. 
The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend 
that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance 
in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has 
licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is 
part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an 
additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50 
percent increase in generation. 
And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right 
sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a 
strong bent toward renewable power sources. 
In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the 
bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the 
effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable 
power sources. 
Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by 
former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta 
Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to 
deal effectively with the energy emergency. 
Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC 
commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their 
appointments. 
Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was 
Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise 
in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president. 
Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to 
buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange. 
This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy 
price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling 
additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make 
California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power 
grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it. 
Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill 
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear 
plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty 
Texas- style power plants in California. 
Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California. 
Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new 
nuclear plants. 
And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a 
Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants. 
Most disingenuously, the apologists would "let the market work," claiming 
that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But 
the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators 
overcharged the state in January. 
Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp 
down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's 
deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market 
forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest 
prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported 
that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since 
1999. 
Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well 
that if the market "works" to produce New York-style rate increases in 
California, the consequences to the public would be dire. 
Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy 
conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his 
expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly. 
Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics' 
perspective.

Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state 
may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the 
next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent. 
The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated 
promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without 
a rate increase. 
California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity 
buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to 
keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back 
on their feet. 
Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would 
have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion. 
But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm. 
"There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the 
negotiations, this can be added up any way you want," said Steve Maviglio, 
press secretary to Davis. 
"Those numbers are not based on any reality right now," he said. "There are 
too many things up in the air." 
Assembly Democrats told a different story. 
They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet 
Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with 
Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell. 
And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow 
lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration. 
They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the 
day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the 
figures. 
PURCHASES IN BILLIONS
The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the 
state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An 
additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year, 
they said. 
The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17 
because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases. 
From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power 
purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the 
amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills. 
Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10 
billion without raising rates. 
But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty 
rate increase would be necessary. 
INCREASE UPON INCREASE
The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a 
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled 
for no later than March 2002. 
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent 
increase would be required to cover the debt service. 
"For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is 
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been 
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the 
reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek 
(Santa Cruz County). 
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them 
out. 
And it could mean political trouble for Davis. 
"Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's 
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002," 
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to 
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. 
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power 
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot 
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as 
rolling blackouts spread across the state. 
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers 
will resume debate Monday. 
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment 
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has 
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. 
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing 
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern 
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators 
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. 
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the 
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. 
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's 
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in 
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds 
$1. 4 billion a month. 
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their 
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. 
"It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They 
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way." 
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to 
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to 
provide energy. 
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The 
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as 
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid 
pennies on the dollar. 
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the 
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so 
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. 
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries 
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost 
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes 
Critics say he should have been at Capitol

N171337.DTL 
While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping 
hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended 
a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert. 
Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare 
Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private 
country club of which Dauner is a member. 
Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped 
by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento. 
But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small 
power generators -- languished in the Assembly. 
On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to 
Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues. 
"There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief 
critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to 
try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass 
in Palm Springs." 
The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends 
raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled 
interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration. 
Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 -- 
averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund- 
raisers directed at specific industries. 
Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to 
dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch" 
preceding the golf. 
South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying 
amounts of money." 
Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues 
important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression 
that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state 
Sen. 
Don Perata, D-Oakland. 
Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad, 
Perata said. 
"We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their 
confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us 
reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted." 
Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the 
problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad. 
"It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the 
benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. 
Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about 
the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the 
state. He appeared live from Palm Springs. 
The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and 
boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through 
both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts." 
Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing 
education and streamline college requirements for nurses. 
One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes. 
The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which 
is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late 
bills owed to hospitals. 
Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction 
health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on 
time. 
In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at 
Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree 
that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year. 
At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at 
those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social 
event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing 
education than anything else." 
Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 23, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PG&E Responds to Energy Proposals in Sacramento 
	San Francisco -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced that it 
will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the State of 
California to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure. The proposed 
actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the 
entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy 
crisis at risk. 
	This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying 
Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1, 
and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any 
other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral 
contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO). 
	"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. "The numbers just don't work." 
	Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been 
collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric 
power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including 
power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of 
operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to 
the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources 
exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months. 
Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by 
the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open 
position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This 
dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional 
liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
	"We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive, 
comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly 
priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers, 
lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must 
challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is 
collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded.

Campaign funds will pay for spots 
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week 
defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political 
campaigning has become a permanent sport. 
Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an 
"information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. 
But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed 
by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. 
"The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with 
the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots 
running since June 19. 
Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the 
governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, 
including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best 
way to fight back against high energy prices." 
Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex 
Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads 
don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is 
paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using 
state money to finance his political ambitions. 
South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads 
that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually 
going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as 
ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. 
"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is 
that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and 
some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am 
mood." 
Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan 
nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said 
the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. 
"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public 
service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they 
may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think 
he has any credibility on this issue." 
Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, 
which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis 
standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The 
West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. 
"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," 
said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President 
Bush in 2004. 
Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy 
companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis 
and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." 
Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had 
contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as 
Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." 
Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has 
contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the 
American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the 
ads running in California through July. 
Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential 
bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for 
the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a 
call for comment yesterday. 
Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are 
worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and 
Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. 
But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. 
Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull 
dramatically increased. 
Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin 
running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy 
supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. 
The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed 
Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for 
Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. 
Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- 
oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as 
the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between 
supply and demand, except through strict conservation. 
"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so 
far," Gillespie said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

Best,
Jeff

No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Hi everyone,

I know that AReM is not opposing SB 78xx (Polanco/Sher) because it is silent
on direct access; however, I want to recommend that the position be changed
to oppose.  I have spoken with Norm and he asked that I send this out to for
comment.
Please look at the bill and specifically Section 13, on Page 35 (see below).
I believe that if this bill were to become law direct access in SCE's,
PG&E's and SDG&E territories (I believe the section stands alone so it
wouldn't matter if PG&E accepted the same deal or not) would be dead.  In
summary, the bill would essentially allow any IOU to go back into the
generation business and require the CPUC to approve rates that are
sufficient to cover their reasonable cost of operation, investment and
provide for a reasonable rate of return (I don't believe this is cost-based
rates).  The CPUC is given broad latitude over conducting proceedings,
issuing orders or anything else that may be necessary to accomplish the goal
of assuring that service provided by IOU's is adequate.  Section 13 will
kill competition, eliminate direct access and create new stranded costs.
And, to add insult to injury the State Power Authority may be their partners
in crime.
As to the politics of the bill it was just amended to be a majority vote
bill.  Burton has said it is this bill or nothing.  SCE is opposing the bill
but there are several lobbyist who think this is all an ambush and SCE would
love this bill.

Please comment on my above analysis.  I would love to be wrong on this one.

SEC. 13. Section 454.10 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:
454.10. (a) In order to assure that the service provided by electrical
corporations is adequate, the commission may require each electrical
corporation that provides distribution service to make direct investments in
electric generation facilities whose output is dedicated to serve the
customers connected to its distribution grid. (b) After a hearing, the
commission shall approve rates sufficient to enable the electrical
corporation to recover its reasonable costs of operation, its reasonable
investment in the electric generation facilities and a reasonable return on
its investment, in accordance with Section 451. (c) An electric corporation
may meet the obligation described in this section by entering into projects
for electric generation facilities jointly with the California Consumer
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. (d) The commission may conduct
proceedings, enter orders and undertake such actions as it considers
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section.

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL 
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight 
bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Subject: RE: Conference Call Advisory for SUNDAY, September 9th
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.

As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.

These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  

I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.

Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.

Talk to you at noon your time.

Best,
Jeff

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. 

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. 

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures." 

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC 

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. 

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said. 

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated." 

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. 

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the second letter says. 

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting.

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see. 

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts. 

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months. 

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record. 

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public. 

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market. 

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.

I have a new description of PG&E's reorg plan-- it is the ultimate
expression of their longstanding affliction with Enron-envy.  Now that
they're cutting loose the UDC/LDC, they can fall flat on their faces with
no safety net (except the hydro, of course).   MIKE

FYI.

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

"Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." 

S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said Freeman, "but it's a good thing to have." 

But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said Marcus. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." 

* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

"When you compare those two contracts," Marcus said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said. 

"I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

Subject: Edison and the PUC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff

Talked to Fielder. He said that he agreed with us (i.e., the PUC decision supports our position) and that he would talk to Edison's DASR people.  He said that if there were any problems, etc., he'd call us on Monday.

Jeff will be talking to Fielder on this.

SCE said at our meeting Monday that they DID NOT want to talk about these issues at the PHC -- they wanted to address it through the advice letters. This one shouldn't even be up an issue at all.

Hi Sue,

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 deadline.

Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20
contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before
September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which
you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D
01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails
supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is
in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on
rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct
access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC
order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or
verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access
service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern
California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20,
2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject
to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your
DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or
verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit
the
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect"
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering
options) for existing Direct Access customers.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.

Hey buddie:  Just got into my email.  Let's discuss.  Not quite sure how this fits with filing an RCR per our discussion.  Either way is fine, but seems like we need to get coordinated.
 
Best,
Jeff

Jeff, 

Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today. I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.  I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.  Jim agreed.  Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach.
