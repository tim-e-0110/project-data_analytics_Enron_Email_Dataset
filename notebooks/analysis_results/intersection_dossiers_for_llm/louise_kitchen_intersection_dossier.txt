Subject: Mieco Inc. Dispute

Attached is a draft letter I have prepared to send to Mieco Inc.'s General 
Counsel.  It responds to Mieco Inc.'s recent inquiries concerning 
EnronOnline's policies and procedures when one party claims a trade has been 
made in error.  I have intentionally made it as short and sweet as possible.  
Let me know your thoughts.  I would like to get the letter out the door by 
the end of the day, if possible.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: Conn. Coal Plants
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.
 
John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants


As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
 
I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
 
Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.

Maybe 1.  But in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 MM every year.  just thinking.

Subject: RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language


Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "Houston Pipe Line Company" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark "HPL".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty "re-accept" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other "cleanup" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to "make it worth their while"..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either "do nothing" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the "innocuous notice" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the "notification route", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita

Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).  Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.

Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.

The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.

Ray,

Eddie Meche (CRO) and Jim Bob Perkins (President) from Reliant will be meeting with you and I in your offices at 8:00AM.   The purpose of the meeting is to continue to educate Reliant on our current financial position.  They have been supportive in the market until last week where they came out with a public announcement with concerns about Enron.  Our hope is to give them further disclosure to get them comfortable with our near term and long term financial plans.  They have $100mm gross exposure ($50mm net exposure) to Enron and have recently slowed trading volumes.

Feel free to give me a call if you need further breifings.  I will be in the office about 7:00AM.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject: 


Attached please find the proposed Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application for Netco.  I have included a clean copy of each document as well as a red-lined copy marked against the version sent to Mark Taylor by Dave and Carl. 
 
You will note that I have made a number of changes to the original EOL documents.  
 
1.  The Password Application.
 
The Password Application contains no substantive changes.  I advise that we retain the original description of the website as a platform for the "purchase and sale of products and instruments based on energy products or other commodities (including derivative products)".  The description is sufficiently broad to cover any potential expansion beyond the original gas and power products, as well as third party product offerings.  After a brief discussion regarding the auction platform with Louise, I revised the PA to reinsert references to the auction.
 
2.  The Electronic Trading Agreement.
 
There are numerous revisions and additions to the ETA.  I outline below a few of the key changes requiring your consideration:
 
a.  I added a sentence at the end of Section 1 to make clear that in the event the ETA conflicted with any other agreement between the parties, including any terms posted on the Website, the ETA controls.
 
b.  I added a new Section 2(h) to address Counterparty content posted on any public area of the Website.  To the extent that we anticipate such a capability in the future, it may be a good idea to include such a provision.  If we do include this section, do we want to limit our license of the content to use on the Website and related materials, as proposed here?  If you do not want to include such a limitation, we can add the word "worldwide" to the first sentence before the word "royalty-free" and delete the balance of the final sentence after the phrase "not distorted by displaying only a part)".
 
c.  I revised Section 3(e) to clarify that Netco is not required to send written confirmations of on-line transactions and to provide that electronic records are admissible as evidence of the transaction.  The last sentence of the section is intended to make clear that to the extent the master agreement requires a written confirmation, such master agreement controls, provided that the failure to send a confirmation will not invalidate the transaction.
 
d.  I added a new Section 4 to address transactions posted by unaffiliated third parties.  (This issue was already covered in the last paragraph of the original PA.)
 
e.  I revised Section 5(a) to clarify that Netco is not liable for any direct damages and to expressly cap its damages to amounts paid by Counterparty for accessing the Website.
 
f.  I revised Section 5(b) and (c) in response to issues raised by many counterparties when I negotiated EOL ETA issues. 
 
g.  Section 6(a) has been revised to expressly provide that Confidential Information excludes counterparty identifying information, as well as transactional or biographical information in statistical form.  Please let me know if you disagree with the scope of this exclusion.  If you don't want to exclude counterpary identifying information, we can merely delete the phrase "the identification of Counterpartt as a user of the Website and shall also exclude".  I added a 1-year term following expiration of the ETA to the confidentiality obligation in Section 6(d), reasoning that most of the confidential information protected by this Section belongs to the Counterparty, not Netco, and thus desiring some cut off point for our obligation to maintain confidentiality.
 
 
A number of our counterparties enter into transaction by and through service companies or agents.  I have prepared a revised Password Application, side letter to the ETA, and Consent and Acknowledgment form to be utilized by such counterparties and attach these documents below for your review and reference as well.
 
Please give me a call with any questions or comments.
 
Regards,
 
Leslie

The only item open, I think, is a deal with EC Outlook concerning the EDI Hub.  Jay  and Bob

He is also working on a list of contracts needed with the pipelines and LDC's.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

Dave,

The download from EOL contract database is not the Day 1 contract list we will be using.  Disregard the Contract/Name Type column in your attachment.  There are only six initial contract types.  Master Gas, Master Power, ISDA and corresponding GTCs.  Also, we will adjust the initial contract requests by Credit Approvals.  We need to be consistent in what we are communicating to UBS and internally.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject:	Contracts listing

Attached is a list of company legal names, with Enron contract types identified, which some of the recipients of this email have requested.

The GROUPS represented on this list roughly correspond to the groups on the various lists in circulation and should be relevant for relaunch.

The list I sent out earlier today contained some company names which had been identified by commercial groups as Top 50, but in fact will not be trading on day 1 as they do not trade the products which we are planning to launch on day 1.

Accordingly, we will send out a new list tomorrow morning, which will contain:

- Names of pipelines or transmission companies needed for day 1
- Names of Canadian companies needed for day 1

The revised list will show only those names incremental to the "Louise approved" list currently being used by credit and will contain the full legal name of the relevant entities.

To avoid any confusion, I suggest you delete the last list I sent you and use the "Louise approved" list along with tomorrow's list.

If anyone has any questions, please contact me on:

office: 713 853 1861
cell: 713 562 8678

Thanks,

Dave

Subject:	The procedure


There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application:

1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 

2) Ostensible Authority.

3) 3rd Party Verification.

For 3rd Party Verification, the following procedure is used after Credit, Legal and Contracts departments have approved the Counterparty for online transactions:

?	The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested

?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded.

?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation.

The Master User ID is forwarded to the customer only upon the verification of the authority of the applicant.

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

Genia:
I left the cover sheet in your chair with the changes that need to be made.  Can you please make those changes?  Thanks.
