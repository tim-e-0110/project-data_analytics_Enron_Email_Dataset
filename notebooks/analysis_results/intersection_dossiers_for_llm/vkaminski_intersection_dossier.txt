Dear Vince,

      The following message is from co-PI, Prof. Baichun Xiao in Long
Island University.
In this message, he told me how Enron would be registered. To my best
knowledge,
IBM, Lucent and other big companies have registered in NSF for long.
Your kindly understanding is acknowledged very much.

     Good weekend,

Youyi

Dear Youyi:

The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.

FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188.
FastLane Availability (Recording): 1-800-437-7408.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to
nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.


Name
Highest Degree
Year Conferred
Present Institution
Department
Street Address
City
State
Zip Code
Social Security Number (SSN)
Email Address
Business Phone Number
Business Fax Number


For more information, you may go to

Shijie,

I am sending you the abstract for my INFORMS presentation.

******************************************************************************

*****


The last three years were characterized by exceptionally high volatility of
the power prices in the US markets. The market developments have created a
number of unique challenges for energy industry economists. One immediate
question we have to answer is how to measure volatility of energy prices.
Although we can all agree that the prices in the power markets are
characterized by high variability, the traditional measures used in financial
economics (annualized standard deviation of log price returns) may not fit
well electricity prices. The second challenge is to explain the sources of
high price volatility and to answer the question to what extent it can be
attributed to problems that can be addressed in the long run. Such problems
include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse
market power, limited availability and/or unequal access to transmission,
temporary shortages of generation capacity. Some factors underlying high
volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a
necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer
choice.

Thanks
Vince. This is good but I also need a title. It would be good if you can as
part of the talk present an example of a technical problem addressed by your
group describing the problem and the general methodology employed or
developed. You can also start with an introduction about your organization
and the program.

Julie,

Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.

Vince

************************************

Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused
on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.

1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean
reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture
the same type of market evolution of prices over time.
2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines
the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool
prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach
is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for
each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of
jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under
investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during
different time slots represent different economic commodities.
Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require
explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total
number of half hourly periods in a year? The same goes for f in Table 2
(article number 3).

One of the most important trends in the energy industry during the last year 
was proliferation of electronic, Internet based, trading platforms for 
wholesale markets and for retail operations. Websites such as 
www.houstonstreet.com and www.altranet.com provide facilities for matching 
buyers and sellers. The website operated by Enron Corp. (EnronOnline) 
represents an alternative solution under which Enron acts as a principal in 
every transaction. On the retail? side, many retail e-commerce companies 
offering auctions, reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers, 
clubs challenge incumbent utilities. The objective of this project is to 
evaluate the impact of e-commerce (both at the wholesale and retail levels) 
on the energy industry. The study will start with comparative analysis of 
different wholesale trading and retail e-commerce business models and 
evaluation of their long-term viability. The next step will be assessment of 
the impact of e-commerce on price dynamics, profit margins and the level of 
competition in different energy markets. A separate section will be devoted 
to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e-commerce 
(incumbent utilities, organized exchanges, energy brokers) to the new 
competitive threat, and different strategies they implement to meet the 
challenge. Organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition 
to screen-based trading that has been already replacing open outcry 
technology. Power and natural gas marketers have created alliances (with 
other industry players, software companies and electronic exchanges) to 
create their own trading platforms. Gas and electric utilities embarked on 
development of vertical and horizontal e-commerce platforms, offering 
services to households and other companies in the energy industry. The 
critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the 
competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by 
the Internet based economy. It's quite obvious that the Internet revolution 
will change the energy industry's landscape during the next few years. The 
objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above, 
based on the currently available information. Additionally, the participants 
should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement 
in case the currently? expected trends fail to materialize.

Produced  Friday, December 29, 2000. 
Our panelists are Elizabeth Dater, Louis  Holland, Barbara Marcin and Brian 
Rogers.

LOUIS  RUKEYSER: Good evening. I'm Louis Rukeyser. This is Wall Street Week.  
Welcome back. 

Well, folks,  now you know why they call it black tie. 

Much of the  world of investors regards 2000 as a year of mourning -- for 
profits past, for  bubbles burst, for bulls de-horned and for certainties 
crumbled.

And let's face  it: It wasn't always fun. 

As Winston  Churchill put it, "I'm always ready to learn, although I do not 
always like to  be taught." 

Virtually  nobody except the non-stop pessimists -- who are still stone 
losers over the  past decade -- foresaw the viciousness of this year's 
declines -- although the  year was contradictory, even there.

For example, is  this a bear market? 

Well, yes and  no.

Even from their  highest heights in early 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average and the  S&P 500 have declined far less than the twenty percent that 
traditionally  has defined a bear market.

But for the  formerly high-flying technology stocks personified by the 
Nasdaq, this has not  only been a bear -- but the growly of all time.

Nasdaq, which  never does things moderately, fell nearly 40 percent this year 
-- and is off  more than 51 percent from its March 10th high. 

That makes this  not only the worst year ever for the 29-year-old Nasdaq, but 
the biggest  decline for any of the three major indexes since the S&P 500 
lost 47  percent in 1931, during the Great Depression. 

So devastating  was this latest, and most severe, tech wreck that any attempt 
to put it in  perspective -- by pointing out, say, that Nasdaq has been the 
bullish  phenomenon of the past decade -- and that it gained more than 85 
percent in  1999 alone -- is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history 
to today's  bleeding tech investors.

Are they right?  Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically 
promising up-trend, or is  it truly the end of a booming era? 

Were the  downward catalysts of 2000 -- a fierce Federal Reserve, a steeply 
weakening  economy and a nation driven to embarrassing self-doubt by the 
Election That  Would Not Die -- passing phenomena or auguries of enduring 
change?

We'll try to  get you some meaningful answers tonight -- in the company of 
four  sharp-shooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our 
viewers  significant money in 2000 while the markets -- and most of their 
competitors  -- faltered. 

We'll review  what really did happen in 2000 -- to the economy and to 
investors -- and we'll  see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in 
the year ahead -- in  which, not to put too fine a point on it, Wall Street 
owes us all a lot!  

But, first,  let's see how the best-performing got better -- and the 
worst-hit got  hysterical -- in a characteristically mixed ending to a 
thoroughly mixed-up  year.

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average ended on a stronger note, despite a 
final-day sell-off,  gaining more than 150 points to close the year at 
10,787.99 -- making this the  Dow's first losing year since 1990.

Most indexes  followed the Dow's upward lead -- with the conspicuous 
exception of, you  guessed it, Nasdaq, which ended the year at less than half 
its March  peak.

But the elves,  filled with the holiday spirit -- or something -- continue to 
insist that  better times lie ahead both for the Dow -- where our haloes go, 
as usual, to  those who voted neutral three months ago, since when the Dow is 
up by just a  bit more than one percent -- and for Nasdaq, which we now 
insist they also  predict -- to see if that can improve their worst overall 
yearly record since  they were created.

There were  minimal changes in the bond and oil markets, and the dollar had a 
mixed week  -- as the long-suffering euro continued its recent rebound.

And if your  investments this year are giving you palpitations, try munching 
some of those  holiday sweets you've been trying to put out of your mind. 

A new report in  the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that 
chocolate may  protect against heart disease.

The theory is  that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent build-up of 
blood  platelets.

Brian Rogers,  what's it going to take to build up investor psychology in 
Wall  Street?

ROGERS:  Well, Lou, I think what we've seen is a very natural transition this 
year away  from some of the higher-flying sectors of 1999. And I think 
investors as we  enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression, 
what the Fed does  with rates, and I think an awful lot will be determined, 
at least in the first  part of the year, on what happens to mutual fund cash 
flows. 

RUKEYSER:  When will we know that? A week or two from now, or will it take 
longer?  

ROGERS:  I think we'll see a lot of indications in January. I think the Fed 
will meet  several weeks into the new year. I think we'll see trends in 
mutual fund cash  flow data evident by the end of January. And then we also 
have the January  effect I suppose we can look forward to, to see how the 
first month of the  year shakes out.

RUKEYSER: So basically, if things don't look a heck of a lot  better by 
mid-January, that's going to be a bad sign.

ROGERS:  You can take the rest of the year off at that point. 

RUKEYSER: Thanks for your encouragement. Barbara Marcin, what do  you think? 
What's it going to take to pep up the investors? 

MARCIN:  Well, I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of 
profit and  growth priced into the market here. And I really think that what 
happened this  year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really 
led the market  down. It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks 
which boomed so  much last year. And last year you could have a reasonable 
return which would  look very mediocre if you weren't invested in those 
stocks, and this year if  you have a reasonable return, it looks very good, 
because the telecom and  technology stocks declined so much. So I think it's 
really just been a matter  of resetting expectations, and I think we can 
still have a good market here  with a broad number of stocks attractively 
priced.

RUKEYSER: So it was a good thing that those jazzed-up fly boys  came down to 
earth, huh? 

MARCIN:  Well, I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market 
certainly,  yes.

RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, Brian mentioned the Fed. How important is  the Fed in 
all this?

HOLLAND:  Well, I think the Fed made a big mistake. I mean they raised 
interest rates,  you know, 6 times in 15 months. You know, basically the 
economy, inflation was  not an issue at the time that they were raising it. 
And now of course they  took money out of the system because they put a lot 
in at the end of '99 for  Y2K issues, and now they've taken it out. So really 
I think they've dropped  the ball here, and I think that they're going to 
have to cut rates here over  the next month or so. 

RUKEYSER:  How much impact will that have? Wall Street expects them to do 
that  doesn't it? 

HOLLAND:  Well, I think it does, Wall Street expects that. But I think, 
again, to  see it is to believe it, and I think to the extent that Greenspan 
has sort of  been a follower, he has not been a leader. So I suspect that any 
positive  action here will be received relatively positively.

RUKEYSER: You mean the markets have led him. 

HOLLAND:  That's exactly right. 

RUKEYSER: And they're now leading him to a rate cut. 

HOLLAND:  Exactly. 

RUKEYSER: I  see. Well, I hope Mr. Greenspan understands that. Beth Dater, 
what do you  think?

DATER:  Well, that's an interesting point, because I think typically the 
stock market  is driven by the economy. What's sort of interesting about the 
last  year-and-a-half is that to some extent the economy has been driven by 
the  stock market and the wealth effect. And so I think what's going to be 
really  important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can 
adjust to  a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more 
like eight  percent than 25 or 30 or high double-digit gains. 

RUKEYSER: The consumer didn't seem to be too sanguine this  Christmas. 

DATER:  No, the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here. 
And I think  the question will be, back to Brian's point, what will happen 
when the  consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual 
fund  business. It's something to watch very closely I think.

RUKEYSER: There was a fall off in the rate of net input into  mutual funds 
last month, which is not surprising. What do you think? Why  should people 
turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds  now?

DATER:  Well, I think there's, I think that consumers also have to adjust to 
the  fact that, you know, the same 25 stocks aren't going to carry 
everything, that  there are areas of diversification, such as fixed income 
and value and other  styles of investing, where one can still receive good 
returns over time.  

RUKEYSER: All right. Now, before we look ahead with our winners  of the year, 
let's review where we've been in a year most investors would love  to forget. 

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average was the year's first victim, falling nearly 
2,000 points  after peaking in mid-January at a record 11,723 -- but then 
gained most of it  back, ending with a loss of just over six percent.

The S&P 500  peaked later -- in March -- but recovered less, losing a bit 
more than ten  percent for the year.

But the true  carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq, which was butchered by 
more than 39  percent.

In contrast,  both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes 
-- which track  all the common stocks traded there -- eked out small gains 
for the year --  while the small-stock Russell 2000 was down by just 4.2 
percent.

Even a bad year  for stocks and a hint of inflation couldn't revive the 
fortunes of the  investment world's longest sufferers -- the gold bugs -- 
whose favorite metal  continued to tarnish. And silver did even worse.

The strong man  of the year was the U.S. dollar, which easily outperformed 
all other major  currencies, with a particularly dazzling gain of 12 percent 
against the  yen.

Meanwhile, the  U.S. economy continued -- as it has now for nearly ten years 
-- what has  become a record expansion -- but new doubts about its durability 
arose as  growth slowed in the third quarter to just 2.2 percent and the 
fourth quarter  seemed even weaker.

There was a  slight whiff of inflation midway through the year, helped along 
by a stunning  rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by 
Fed officials, who  last year took the Y2K threat too seriously. By November, 
there was some  relief -- consumer prices for the past 12 months had 
increased 3.4 percent,  ahead of the pace a year ago, but off the summer 
highs.

Continuing to  defy old-fashioned economic textbooks, unemployment remained 
low, even as  inflation blipped -- and the economy chugged forward. U.S. 
unemployment  reached a three-decade low at 3.9 percent, and as of the last 
monthly report,  in November, was still holding at just four percent.

Even the  ever-edgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation -- and with 
the  prospect of a softer economy, the ghouls rejoiced. The yield on the 
30-year  Treasury bond was driven down to 5.46 percent -- more than a full 
point lower  than where it was a year ago.

But short-term  rates -- which are more-easily controlled by the Federal 
Reserve -- climbed  nearly as much as long rates fell. The average yield on 
taxable money-market  funds is now up to six percent.

The year's big  international economic story was oil. From below $11.00 a 
barrel just two  years ago, oil climbed over $37.00 this past September 
before retreating to  today's $26.80 -- a little more than a dollar higher 
than a year  ago.

For the fourth  year in a row, the U.S. trade deficit is setting a record in 
2000 -- and next  April will mark a full quarter-century since the U.S. last 
saw even a monthly  trade surplus.

And where do we  go from here? The Conference Board's index of so-called 
leading economic  indicators has been anemic throughout 2000 with outright 
negative readings in  four of the past five months.

Brian Rogers,  which of these numbers, if any, is the one to watch in the 
2001  markets?

ROGERS:  Lou, I think the most important thing will be what happens to 
corporate  earnings in the first half. Things have been sluggish in the 
second half of  this year, and I think as we enter the new year corporate 
profitability will  be the most important thing affecting how investors view 
markets. 

RUKEYSER: And what's your guess on how that will turn out?  

ROGERS:  I think we'll have a decent profit year, but when I say decent, Lou, 
my best  guess is in the five to seven percent range, and not much more than 
that, from  a corporate profitability standpoint. 

RUKEYSER: Do you think the markets are expecting that?  

ROGERS:  I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that, which 
makes me  think we might continue to have some, again some choppiness in the 
first part  of 2001. 

RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, what are you going to keep your eye on? 

MARCIN:  I'm going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels. You 
know, we  had three forces which slowed the economy this year: the Federal 
Reserve  raising interest rates, high oil and gas prices, and really a sharp 
drop off  in consumer confidence as the stock market fell, and that slowed 
spending a  lot. And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers 
really  stopped spending, that could spiral a little bit more into companies  
incorporating that and having layoffs, and really then we could get a  
recession. So that's what I'm keeping my eye on.

RUKEYSER: Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this  whole 
expansion. 

MARCIN:  Yes.

RUKEYSER:  There are some signs they're flagging a little, but you want to 
see how  much. 

MARCIN:  Yes. 

RUKEYSER: What's your guess? 

MARCIN:  I think that, right now I'm not predicting a recession, so I'm not 
predicting  that they're going to flag that much more. We just had, this week 
the third  straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence. And I think 
that perhaps,  come the new year, we can regain it, but that is what I'm 
concerned about.  

RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, how about you? 

HOLLAND:  I agree with Barbara. I think the consumer sentiment has 
deteriorated, and I  think that there's probably a greater than 50-50 chance 
that we're probably  going to have a recession. It's sort of the old notion 
of the Federal Reserve  pushing on the string in order to get the economy 
going by reducing rates or  injecting money into the system. And I'm not so 
sure that the system will  swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling 
into recession.

RUKEYSER: So you think the Fed has waited far too long.  

HOLLAND:  I think so. 

RUKEYSER:  Do you think there's a chance that they'll cut more than a quarter 
percent  next month? 

HOLLAND:  I think it's possible that they could have an interim meeting to 
cut, and I  think it's very possible they could cut a half a point. 

RUKEYSER:  Beth, can you cheer me up any more? 

DATER:  Well, I think it gets down to interest rates, because I think that is 
what  will ultimately influence the consumer confidence. I'm a little bit 
concerned  about the dollar in here. I mean I think that we have had a huge 
amount of  foreign investment also into our capital markets here, and if the 
dollar were  to weaken substantially, that might be at risk, and we might see 
some  repatriation of some of those foreign investments. 

RUKEYSER: All right. Now comes the moment of truth when we turn  the 
spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago.

In what has  been for decades the toughest competition in investing -- the 
lists cannot be  changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months -- 
it was a tough year  even for our certified geniuses -- though the average of 
all our panelists  continued to beat the performance of the S&P 500, let 
alone the sagging  Nasdaq. 

You can check  all their records on our web site. It will be up after 
midnight tonight. As  you'll see, the five who actually defied the odds, and 
made you money in 2000,  included the four stalwarts here tonight.

Brian Rogers,  to show what a weird year it was, you were the second-closest 
of all our  panelists, behind Marty Zweig, in predicting the Dow's 2000 high 
and close --  though even you were too optimistic by nearly 800 and 1,000 
points,  respectively. That was good this year.

But in the  far-more-important, actual money-making part of the competition, 
you excelled  -- with a portfolio of specific recommendations that, according 
to  calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets, was up a 
whopping  42.5 percent, aided by three timely short sales and a near-double 
in Bergen  Brunswig. Congratulations!

ROGERS:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, with both you and Brian here, it's clearly the 
value  players' night out. While your prediction that the Dow would get above 
14,000  turned out to be ridiculously high, you came within 11 points -- 11 
points --  of nailing the precise Dow low of 9796.03. And better still, your 
portfolio is  up more than 40 percent in this generally-grim year -- thanks 
to the best  single pick of any panelist, Everest Reinsurance Holdings -- 
which rewarded  you with a 222-percent gain. So thanks, Barbara, for bringing 
us so much  value! 

MARCIN:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER:  Lou Holland, welcome back to your fourth year-end appearance, the 
most of  any panelist here tonight, and you earned it. While your high, low 
and close  were way off the mark -- a familiar song this year -- your 
portfolio was up  more than 28 percent, powered by the more-than-doubling of 
Washington Mutual.  Way to go, Lou. 

HOLLAND:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER: Beth Dater, this is your third year-end program. And  your cautious 
approach to investing in 2000 -- including putting 20 percent of  the 
portfolio in three-year Treasury notes -- paid off with an average gain of  
more than 7.5 percent. In 2000, that looked awful good. So congratulations,  
Beth.

DATER:  Thank you, Lou. 

RUKEYSER:  But enough with the compliments -- however well-earned in a year 
like this  past one. There's a new, and we hope different, year ahead -- and 
what have  you done for us lately? For starters, in our annual triumph of 
hope over  experience, let's hear from each of you the true inside word on 
the highest  close, the lowest close, and the final close for both the Dow 
Jones Industrial  Average and Nasdaq in 2001. And this time, gang, let's all 
get it exactly  right. 

Brian?

ROGERS:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,500, a low of 10,000, and a 
close of  11,900. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 3,000, a low of 2,000, and a 
close of  2,250. 

RUKEYSER: Barbara? 

MARCIN:  For the Dow, I have a high of 13,000, a low of 10,500, and a close 
of 12,000.  And for Nasdaq, a high of 3,200, a low of 2,500, and a close of  
3,000.

RUKEYSER: Lou? 

HOLLAND:  For the Dow, I have a high of 12,936, a low of 10,100, and a close 
of  12,504. For the Nasdaq, I have a high of 3,090, a low of 2,101, and a 
close of  2,842.

RUKEYSER: Beth?

DATER:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,175, a low of 9,781, and a 
close of  11,740. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 2,834, a low of 2,404, and a 
close of  2,734. 

RUKEYSER:  Okay. Well, one thing is for sure -- and this is my only 
personal,  unqualified guarantee of the night: At least some of them will be  
wrong.

But, if you'd  like to see the full predictions, with specific stock 
selections, from all 22  of our panelists, all those lists will be included 
in tonight's transcript --  which you can get for $7.50 by writing to 
Year-End Transcripts, Wall $treet  Week With Louis Rukeyser, Owings Mills, 
Maryland 21117 -- or, you can order  on-line, for $10.00, by visiting our web 
site at: pbs.org.

And now, let's  see what these fabulous four think are the very best buys for 
2001.

Brian?

ROGERS:  Lou, Aon Corp, Cypress Semiconductor, Disney, Exodus Communications, 
Fortune  Brands, Hasbro, Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Fund, Motorola, 
Octel, Ryder  (System), Sprint (FON Group), and Unisource Energy.

RUKEYSER: Barbara? 

MARCIN:  I'm keeping the two from this year's list that did not perform, and 
that's  Cendant and Mattel, and I'm adding Compaq, WorldCom, Lucent, Loral 
(Space  & Communications), AT&T Wireless, and Motorola. 

RUKEYSER: A little tech in there, hmm? 

MARCIN:  Yes. 

RUKEYSER:  Tech's going to have a little comeback you think? 

MARCIN:  That's right. Tech and telecom maybe.

RUKEYSER: Some of those bleeding people will be very happy to  hear that from 
a cautious person like yourself. Lou? 

HOLLAND:  Okay, I have Carnival Corp., CEC Entertainment, Ceridian Corp., 
Clorox  Company, Chase Manhattan Bank, Cognos Inc., Intel -- one of your 
favorites,  Louis -- Home Depot, Jabil Circuit, Microsoft, and WorldCom. 

RUKEYSER: My favorites are the ones that go up. The ones I hate  are the ones 
that go down. You know what Will Rogers said, there's nothing  hard about the 
stock market. You buy a stock, and when it goes up, you sell  it. If they 
don't go up, you don't buy. Beth Dater, your list? 

DATER:  Lou, 25% weighting in 3-year U.S. Treasury notes. The balance equally 
weighted  in Amgen, Berkshire Hathaway, Cisco Systems, Intel, MedImmune, 
Mellon Bank,  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Royal Dutch Petroleum, 
Schlumberger, Wal-Mart, and  Westwood One.

RUKEYSER:  Hearing as much financial services as I do, is that an interest 
rate  forecast as well?

DATER:  It's an interest rate forecast, and also it's a call on valuations, 
which I  think are still very interesting in that area. 

RUKEYSER: How about some of those fallen giants that you've  picked? That 
suggests to me that you don't think it's the end of the world.  

DATER: I  do not think it's the end of the world. And I do think it's a time 
of some  uncertainty and it's a time to think of preservation of capital 
first and  foremost, and therefore, I'm going with some household names at 
this point.  

RUKEYSER: Especially some that have been knocked so far down  that... 

DATER:  Exactly. The valuations are coming into reasonable levels.

RUKEYSER: Brian Rogers, let's hear from you on interest rates.  What do you 
think? 

ROGERS:  Lou, I think we'll see a normalization of the yield curve this year, 
so I  think we'll see short rates fall. The Fed will cut rates probably a 
couple of  times. And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in 
calendar  year 2000. I think that game is probably mostly over would be my 
best guess.  

RUKEYSER:  And short-term rates you don't think are going to fall that much?  

ROGERS:  No, I think short-term rates will fall causing the yield curve to  
look...

RUKEYSER:  But how much do you think they'll fall? 

ROGERS:  I think they'll fall at least 50 or 75 basis points this year. 

RUKEYSER: Okay. If we can get that over the next two weeks, that  might help 
some of your inflows into your mutual funds.

ROGERS:  Well, we'll be happy then. 

RUKEYSER:  Thank you all very much. There we do have to stop. I hope you'll 
join me  next week twice -- first, for our regular program when my guest will 
be the  incomparable Abby Joseph Cohen -- and then for a very special, 
hour-long  "Louis Rukeyser's 2001 Money Guide" -- when my guests will include 
four  world-class industrial titans -- true shapers of our future in the year 
-- and  the century -- ahead.

Meanwhile, this  has been "Wall Street Week." I'm Louis Rukeyser, wishing you 
a happy -- and  infinitely more prosperous -- New Year.

Vince,
I must apologize to you about the version of the paper i sent last evening.
i was pretty exhausted from the day and didn't stop to give it a proof
reading (on paper). I still find that screen editing is a poor substitute
for holding the paper and marking it up.
There is still work to be done but I think the paper is improving with each
iteration. I want to work more on documenting the specific "events leading
up to the formation of the new unregulated business" including some
documentation on the deregulation process and events in the natural gas
market. Specifically, I remember conversations about "take or pay" contract
defaults, etc. and the financial crisis they created. Also, Gene Humphries
commented in a round table discussion that Sheridan held at UT that Carl
Ichan made a play for Enron and this was fended off with a leveraged ESOP.
I would like to get all the details to these issues to better "set up the
section on marching to the beat of a new drummer".
I hope this process isn't too frustrating for you. I am convinced that we
will winnow out the story in the end if we persevere.
Have a great weekend.
your friend,
john

Hi Paul,

I've just done a send/receive messages from home  and ours passed during this

Best regards.

Hi  Chris,
?
Following a meeting today to discuss the forward  plan, the decision has been 
made to shelve the VAR course in it's current  format. An?re-run of the 
previous event has been agreed. There have been  a number of events that were 
to be re-researched and radically altered, but  with the number of new events 
on the schedule, producer time and budgets have  been taken up by the larger 
conferences. 
?
I  would like to apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused. I will 
be  responsible for a number of events on credit risk management, real 
options  theory, exotic options and weather risk management in the second 
half of the  year and will send a calendar to give more notice for these 
events. Victoria  Kerridge will be producing our largest annual energy event 
in Europe and I  have forwarded your details for a possible presentation and 
post-conference  seminar opportunity. If you have any questions please drop 
me a  line.
?
Best  wishes,
?

Hi  Chris,
?
Just  an extra note regarding the course. If the reimbursements are suitable 
I would  like to finalise the line-up ASAP (Vince and a European Enron 
representative).  If you were unable to participate I would need to offer 
alternative  invitations by the end of this week.
?
All  the best,

Hi  Chris,
?
I've  been looking at the forward plan and the total budget for speaker 
expenses is  5500 pounds (US keyboard, no pound sign). At current exchange 
rates this comes  to a little over 15,000 Australian dollars. I would be 
happy to cover your  expenses up to this figure.
?
The  course is scheduled to run in Amsterdam (not London as originally 
planned) and  Houston. The dates are slightly flexible?to?work with your 
travel  schedules. For instance, would you prefer to travel to  
Sydney-Houston-Amsterdam-Sydney, or in the opposite  direction?
?
If  you could contact me to?let me know if this would?enable you to  commit 
to the course, I would be delighted to forward the notes from the  research. 
I would plan to then work on the outline until March  1st.I look forward to 
speaking with you  soon.
?
Best  wishes,
?
Paul  Bristow?

Hi Chris,
?
I would like to confirm the dates of some of the  forthcoming EPRM events:
?
Effective VaR and stress testing  techniques for the US energy industry. This 
event will run on the  21 & 22 May in London and the 28 & 29 May in Houston. 
Michele Du  Berry (Director of Conferences) and I are looking at how we have  
structured the training courses and are keen to present a different  outline 
than on previous courses. I would like to run this event with 2-3  trainers 
per venue, rather than with 7-8 as we have done in the past. If  you and Les 
Clewlow would be interested in leading this course (possible  with Vince 
Kaminski) I would be delighted to discuss the event in greater  detail.
?
Energy & Power Risk Management,  Europe. Our largest annual European event is 
scheduled to between  September 19-21. Victoria Kerridge will be producing 
this event from the  London office and will be starting research in two 
weeks. I am going to be  providing her with a brief and will ensure that she 
has your contact  details.
?
I have also been finalizing the details for the  annual Energy & Power Risk 
Management event in Houston. This will take  place on May 14th & 15th and is 
close to completion. I would be happy  to provide you with more details, 
without potentially running the risk of  overloading your schedule with a 
number of events in a short space of time  (VaR and EPRM, Houston). My 
priority is to secure trainers for our VaR  course.
?
If you would be interested in any of the events  listed, I would be happy to 
talk with you this week. My direct line is 212  925 6990, extension 225. 
?
Best wishes,
?

Hi Paul,
?
Just a note so that you have my address. Do  you have dates for the US and 
European conferences yet? I'm sure that we  can arrange other work at the 
same time to offset the expenses of  speaking at these events if you want us 
to participate.
?
You also mentioned a training course on VaR  and the energy area. We had an 
EPRM article last year with Vince on a  comparison of the different 
techniques on a trial portfolio that might  form the basis of something 
useful. Anyway, let me know.

> 8)  Venture Capital within energy industry

> You are  on the right track getting companies involved. Typical

> I also would take  this opportunity to update on the ongoing

> have your feedback, suggestion on how to  group them in the
> roundtable.
> We got great  support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell
> (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco,  Phillips, and
> Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the  club to
> them as well.  The major  challenge for us is not transform the Energy

> club and it works very well.   We want first educate about the energy
> industry in general, and second  present the opportunities for MBAs in
> the industry in different areas,  including finance but not limited
> to.
>
> Topics  of Roundtable Meetings:
>
> 0)  Energy "101"
> 1)  Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller)
> 2)  Energy Consulting
> 3)  Financial Services (trading, risk management)
> 4)  Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) -

> 5)  Project Development, strategic planning

> 9)  Structuring of Products

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A "Tale of Two Companies"  
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis  

Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in  the third quarter, reporting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents  per diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the  same period in 2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and  boosted the company's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization  of $14.5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a5 2-week high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the  company's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500  companies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778  people. 
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for  the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several  of its non-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the  write-offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share,  and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000.  Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currentlyt rading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company and is  considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron employs 20,600  people. 
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and  appears to still be on a roll in terms of its financial performance. In  contrast, Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently  languishing in a low ebb, characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened  scrutiny of the company's financial reporting. While the two companies operate  in the same market space of power trading and are fierce competitors,  Dynegy-ironically the younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry  success story while Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be  addressed in this article are: What is Dynegy doing "right"? What is Enron doing  "wrong"? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this  "tale of two companies"? 
Although they are often referred to as "cross-town rivals,"  Dynegy and Enron are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their  divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be thes ingle-most important element related to their disparate positions at the end of  2001. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies,a nd-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strategy  is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on two key  areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key areas are the  ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies  have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors. 
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and  converged into the power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where  their similarities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy havef ollowed decidedly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather  rudimentary, let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it  needs to own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gast rading sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of  physical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company  as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. 
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron  first since it is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy  is difficult to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literallyc reates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to  customers. The participation and success in commodity markets, according toE nron, does not necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company  has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to  its wholesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a newp hilosophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell  the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. 
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns  2,000 MW of generation and 41,600 kilometers of electric T&D lines) in 1996  as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When  competition fizzled in that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales  block (a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at thisw riting). Likewise in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent tradingc ompanies, Enron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge inE ngland and, unlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional  generating units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to  its most recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  Enron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint  ownerships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies  operating in the power trading sector. 
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear andr adically different from Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, "Dynegy's  long-term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets,  which supports earnings sustainability." Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy  has been on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing  its generation capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of  generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,000  miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive areas. The  company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the U.S. market,  within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired assets throughp artnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just as often it has  purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy acquired Illinova in  early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating capacity. Dynegy is now  attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, where it is presently planning  to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in England. Dynegy executives have  argued that natural-gas storage is the best way to back up a natural-gas trading  operation. There's no question that the approach is working. Out of the $286  million that Dynegy reported in the third quarter, $263 million of it came from  the company's main wholesale business. 
The issue of asset ownership is probably the centrald efining difference between Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be  overlooked. It is not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach.  Owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in  the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets  and anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actual  output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a trader  such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a  particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load and when  shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on infrastructure,  it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless theya ctually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By the same token,  those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication  with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (the difference between  various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his  company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price, and being  capable of resolving balances when shortages exist. This may be more difficult  for a company such as Enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of  its own to meet discrepancies in power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both  natural-gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on  both commodities. 
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made  that Enron's approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading  volatility. Certainly, by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron  has less capital on the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a  scenario when market prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not  have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than  an asset-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet thef ixed payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find  that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities  in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasinglyf ocused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential concern for  investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establishingp urchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements  is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What Enron gains by  this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a  specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio. 
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be  considered the "great debate" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's  overall performance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not  necessarily provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring  new generation facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted  primarily from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses  (broadband and water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core  wholesale trading business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO  Ken Lay has been quick to reiterate to investors. "Our 26-percent increase in  recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core  wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines," Lay said.  "The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadingm arket position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook." 
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical  assets, the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy  and Enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing  new lines of business. Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point.  Enron, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged  into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the  leadership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into  purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly  become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company "could have gotten into the  broadband business with less capital" and that Enron "spent too much too soon"  in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non-recurringw rite-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and isp resently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing futurec osts in this sector to $40 million a quarter. 
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding  into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when  compared to Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of thet elecom sector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its  broadband business compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported.  However, Dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities  (electricity and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a verym ethodical way that merely supplements its core business. 
It is also important to note that Enron gained the  first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, an electronic tradinge xchange. In fact, Enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy  space, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend withc reating Dynegydirect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their  trading standards, but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular  case Enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well  ahead of its competitors. The latest available information indicates thatE nronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since  its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in  notional transactions. 
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with  regard to their approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often  been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently  struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange  Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's  CFO. To my recollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing ab alance sheet, and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more  solid. As I don't expect either company to radically alter its competitives trategy any time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we  will continue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy  and Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. As  noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, but  clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. Thatd oesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way to strike  a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses  that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous. 
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is  rather like the tortoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which  company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between  the two is far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point,b ased on its more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is  how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly  modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies.

>   First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing

> implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
> and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
> PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
> %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
> is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
> that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for
> alarm.)
> Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
> software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
> unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
> PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
> for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
> a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
> the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
> only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
> that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control
> area
> to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
> imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.
>

Top notch financial analysts are needed for another one of CSC's energy
clients, Cinergy,  located here in Houston.  Again, your
pre-screening/recommendations are invaluable.  If you know of anyone,
please get their resume to me, and I will pass it along to our Account

To whom it may concern: 
I would appreciate if you could forward to the editors my formal complaint regarding 
the behavior of one of the reporters working for your organization. 
Complaint 
My name is Vince Kaminski and I was quoted by Ms. Kristen Hays in her 
article on Enron (the link is provided below). Her behavior represents in my view a 
violation of ethical standards that every journalist should observe. 
I did not talk to Ms. Hays. She did not ask me any questions. She 
might have been the lady sitting at my table at the luncheon and she 
may have overheard bits and pieces of conversation I had with my 
friend. I shall be glad to submit the name of a witness who was talking to me  
and sitting next to me through the entire meeting and who walked out with me from 
the building. 
I am not sure if an organization of your reputation can tolerate similar 
questionable practices of collecting information. Eavesdropping on a 
private conversation is not an acceptable behavior in a civilized 
society. If you would like to endorse such behavior, you should 
provide Ms. Hays with a hearing aid. Yahoo - Analyst: Enron Crash a 'Morality Tale'

Wealth Partners Presents a Special Program for Ex-Enron Employees, entitled

Transitions: Your Job, Your Career, Your Family, Your Finances
Keeping it all together, through the change.

Four Dynamic Experts will address several of the key issues that are
important to you, right now, during a period of transition.

    Kathie Nordt, president of I-focus, a technical recruiting firm,
will discuss how to market yourself in the new tight market environment.

    John Elder, creator of a grass-roots investment program to develop
abandoned research begun by Enron, will discuss the metaphor of "gold in
abandoned mines."

    Kimber Seal, Ph.D. in psychology, will discuss the very human
element of anxiety presented during transitions, and how to keep the family
harmonious during this time.

    Bill Dendy, Certified Financial Planner, will discuss personal
finances during transition; your choices, challenges, and opportunities.

Seminar Location and Times

AGAINST THE GRAIN
Caught Off Balance
Bond sleuths were ahead on Enron. Now they have their sights  on three others.
Herb Greenberg
Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2002
If you learn nothing else from the Enron mess, take this lesson to  heart: A company's inability to handle its debt can be its downfall--no  matter how much Wall Street likes its stock. Indeed, while earnings may  be a window to a company's psyche, the balance sheet is what gives you a  truer picture of its well-being. Bond analysts make a beeline to this  crucial piece of financial disclosure, paying special attention to a  company's ability to service its debt. And when the ratio of cash to  debt plunges--watch out! 
The best balance-sheet snoops are often way ahead of the pack in finding  signs of trouble. Sometimes, however, the big credit-rating firms,  Standard & Poor's and Moody's, which get paid by the companies they  rate, are slow off the mark--slower, as a rule, than independent  bond-rating services like Egan-Jones of Wynnewood, Pa., or research  firms like New York-based Gimme Credit. "We don't have the constraint of  trying to keep a company happy," says Egan-Jones President Sean Egan,  whose downgrade of Enron to junk beat the big guys by about a month. (To  be fair, Moody's is revising how it assesses companies, taking into  account additional information that could lead to a default. Standard &  Poor's, for its part, argues that its existing methods are adequate.) 
Given the scope--and the surprise--of the Enron failure, it's worth  asking: Are there other companies out there that these aggressive  independent credit-rating agencies are flagging now? You can bet on it.  We're not necessarily talking future Enrons, but simply companies whose  financial situation is more dire than the market thinks. Certainly one  where the alarm bells are ringing loudly (and which--don't remind  me--got a positive nod from this column a year ago) is Ford Motor. It's  no secret that Ford is having serious problems, but you wouldn't know it  from its credit rating, which is still investment grade. Egan-Jones,  however, labels it BBB-, a few notches lower than the other rating  agencies do and just one step above junk. That's where Egan-Jones thinks  Ford will arrive within six months, as the sales boost from the much  heralded 0% financing starts to wane and bad auto loans pile up. Junk  status raises the cost of borrowing and would be particularly damaging  for Ford, whose ability to cover its debt has been deteriorating  rapidly. Egan and other bond analysts measure this by calculating a  company's interest coverage ratio--pretax income plus interest expense  divided by interest expense. 
The ratio, which varies widely by industry, is key to credit analysis.  Egan calculates that Ford's interest coverage has tumbled from 2.2 in  September 2000 to just above 1 now. "That's akin to saying that nearly  everything you earn will have to be used to pay your interest expense,  which doesn't leave a lot of money to invest in the business," he says.  Ford responds that it's "disappointed" by the Egan-Jones rating; both  S?and Moody's insist they haven't been laggards and that their ratings  are appropriate. 
Egan-Jones is even warier of computer maker Hewlett-Packard. Its credit  picture is as imperiled as its proposed Compaq merger, according to  Egan-Jones--which has already tossed the tech giant's debt on the junk  heap with a rating of BB+, several notches below that of the major  rating agencies. "It's appropriate to view Hewlett-Packard on a  stand-alone basis, which is not particularly attractive," Egan says.  "Today it is hard to name any business where it's the undisputed  leader--even its printer business is being attacked." Making matters  worse: From October 2000, Hewlett-Packard's interest coverage has sunk  steadily from 19 to just 6.6. (By contrast, IBM's ratio, according to  Egan-Jones, is 11.7.) Hewlett-Packard officials couldn't be reached for  comment. 
Finally, there's retailer Gap (another company this column once argued  you should never bet against, because of its miracle-working marketing  genius of a CEO, Mickey Drexler). While Gimme Credit's Carol Levenson  says Gap's balance-sheet condition is not yet critical, it's "not nearly  as strong as it used to be." Egan-Jones points out that Gap's interest  coverage ratio has plunged from 27.3 down to 8.8 over the past four  quarters. As a result, the firm rates the retailer's debt one step above  junk and a couple of notches below that of both Standard & Poor's and  Moody's ratings. Gap officials say they have never "worked" with  Egan-Jones and point to the retailer's standing with the major rating  agencies instead. The problem is, as Enron proved, those agencies are  not always the first to sound the alarm.

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 11/1/2002

This week rating agency Standard & Poor's said innovatively structured collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) will spur the growth of structured finance products in 2002. The agency predicts a market worth more than $500 billion this year. S&P has reacted to the expected growth of such alternative investments by developing criteria for rating debt secured by the market value of hedge funds. And expects that rating these CDOs will encourage a wider investor base for the deals which, to date, have been dominated by niche investors.

Also this week, New York-based interdealer broker GFI launched what a market participant said was the first stage in its effort to create an online OTC electricity derivatives market in North America, via a soft launch in Alberta. Traders will be able to hedge electricity prices using electricity swaps and options, including base, peak and off-peak terms from day-ahead through the forward curve to calendar years via the new system. The broker has already combined voice and electronic brokerage trading in Europe - becoming the leading broker for German electricity. Should the Alberta project prove successful, it is likely that GFI will roll-out the hybrid model across North America, starting in the eastern seaboard area of the US.

In other energy news, Ohio-based utility American Electric Power (AEP) is set to enter the Nordic power market after its London-based European trading arm, AEP Energy Services, assumed operation of Enron's offices in Oslo and Stockholm. AEP gained an established team of 35 former employees of Enron Nordic Energy, which trades power and weather derivatives in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany.

Meanwhile, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda) has hit back at calls for more derivatives regulation in the wake of Enron's demise. "Advocating regulation for regulation's sake is bad policy and could severely affect the US's role in global financial activity," said Robert Pickel, Isda chief executive, in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. "If OTC derivatives did not cause the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy does not pose a risk to the markets, the logical conclusion is that there is no argument for additional derivatives regulation. It is unclear... how additional regulation of Enron's derivatives trading operations would have prevented or mitigated Enron's financial difficulties," said Pickel in the letter.

This Appeal has been set up for the immediate families of, and any persons financially dependent on, those attending the Risk Waters financial technology conference on the 106th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, who lost their lives in the terrorist attack. Those attending the conference included many delegates, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as 16 people working for Risk Waters (UK, EU and US individuals).
The initial trustees of the Appeal Fund will be Peter Field (chairman & chief executive, Risk Waters Group Ltd), Dennis Waters (chairman & chief executive officer, GenomeWeb LLC, and director, Risk Waters Group Ltd ) and Andrew Farley (solicitor, Boodle Hatfield, London). Risk Waters Group Ltd will be able to appoint new or additional trustees.
The trustees of the Fund will have discretion over how and to what extent to benefit individual claimants and their decisions will be final. As long as the trustees act honestly and in good faith they will not be legally liable for the exercise of their discretion nor for any loss that may occur to the funds raised, howsoever caused. The Fund will not itself be a charity, but any surplus will be applied for such charitable purposes as the trustees think most appropriate to commemorate those who died.

Dear Vince
 
Further to my telephone conversation with Shirley,  I am writing concerning the GARP 2002 Convention, which will be held in New York  on 12-13 February. I have set a new deadline for the presentational slides,  Friday 4th January, and would like to touch base with you about  this. Your two areas of participation are:
 
1. a 40 minute presentation in 12th February on  Measuring energy risk - tackling price volatility, adapting VAR,  scenario modelling and regulatory requirements
 
2. co-presenting a one-day workshop on energy risk  management with Mark Williams on 14 February. I have attached a copy of the  brochure for your information.
 
I have also attached a hotel booking form, since I  am unsure whether this was sent to you.
 
Please keep me informed as to your progress, though  I hope to receive the presentational slides by January 4. If there are any  difficulties or questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

Tax Law Changes Update

Well, it's off - at least for now.  Congressional leaders weren't
able to agree on the contents of an economic stimulus package by
the end of 2001.  Renewed efforts toward a recovery plan have been
introduced by both parties this month -- Senate Majority Leader
Daschle proposes a plan in which businesses would receive a tax
credit for creating new jobs or raising workers' salaries, and
provide a depreciation bonus for equipment investments.  President
Bush continues to support a plan that would accelerate marginal tax
rate cuts enacted last June, provide favorable tax treatment for
businesses investing in new equipment, and provide additional
unemployment benefits.

One important bill did make it through, however: the Victims of
Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001 was passed by Congress on December
21, 2001.  This bill extends relief to the survivors of victims of
the September 11 attacks as well as to victims of anthrax attacks
and the Oklahoma City attack.  Among other provisions, the bill
waives income tax liability for all victims of these attacks for
the year of death.  Click here to read more about this important
bill: <a href="http://turbotax.0mm.com/tax027002">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/55881</a>

How Rollovers to IRAs Work

We've received several questions this past month about rollovers to
and from IRA accounts.  The rules covering rollovers can be confusing
- certain rules must be followed to ensure that you're not taxed when
you take money out of a retirement plan and put it into an IRA.
Here's the general rule: you're not taxed when you move the money you
have in a retirement account over to an IRA account or even from one
IRA to another IRA - but as with nearly everything involving taxes,
there are exceptions.  Learn more about the IRA rollover rules - and
how they changed for 2002.

Ask the Expert

Q:  If you have a loss in an IRA account, can you sell out of that
stock and report that loss on your tax return?
A:  No, you can't.  Your IRA is a "tax-deferred" account, meaning
that all transactions, whether resulting in income or losses, aren't
subject to taxes until you actually withdraw the money, presumably
when you retire.  This is a very common question in times of economic
downturn - the obvious upside of IRA accounts is that in an economic
boom, your gains in your IRA aren't taxable either until withdrawal.

Q:  We have recently refinanced our home.  What are the tax
implications and can we deduct the points associated with the
refinancing?
A:  With most refinancings, you can deduct the points you pay for
your new loan, but there's a twist:  you'll have to deduct them
proportionately over the length (number of years) of your new loan.
So, if your new loan has a 30-year term, you'll deduct 1/30th of your
points each year.

A couple of things to consider: if this isn't the first time you've
refinanced your home mortgage, and you have points from the earlier
loan that you hadn't finished deducting, you may write off the rest
of those points in the year you refinance.  Also, if you refinance,
and you used some of the money from the refinance for home
improvements, you can deduct a portion of those points this year.
For more information on the rules for deducting points, see Points
Deduction Rules at <a href="http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/54158">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/54158</a>

Q: We realized a large capital gain from the sale of real estate in
the year 2000 and had to pay the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Our income for the year 2001 is much less than the prior year.  Is
there any credit that carries over from the AMT?
A:  Yes, there is - it's called the "Credit for Prior Year Minimum
Tax" and it's calculated on Form 8801.  If you prepared your return
using TurboTax for 2000 and you transfer your data into TurboTax for
2001, Form 8801 will be filled out for you automatically.  The credit
applies only if your AMT was caused by something called "timing
differences", which may or may not be the case in your situation. For
a complete explanation of how the AMT works and how this credit is
determined, see the Alternative Minimum Tax article online.

Get Financially Organized

Many folks have set a New Year's resolution to save more money, a
habit that can allow us to build a nest egg, regardless of whether
the economy is up or down.  Astute savers we know have one trait in
common - they're financially organized and proactive.  They know
where their money goes, they stick to a budget, and they pay bills
promptly to avoid wasting money on penalties and interest.  If you'd
like to get organized, but worry that the effort to do so won't fit
into your busy schedule, here's a tip.  The number #1 tool for
getting financially organized is Quicken(R) 2002 Deluxe, personal
financial software that helps you easily track and categorize
expenses, set up a budget step-by-step, and get alerts when you are
close to overspending or when bills are due.  Both Windows(R) and
Macintosh(R) versions are available.  Order now and get the year off
to a good start.

Tax Tips

Tip 1:
Not sure what the due dates are for your returns or your estimated
tax payments?  Check out our Tax Calendar! You'll quickly find all of
the important tax dates coming up this year.
Click here: <a href="http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/36657">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/36657</a>

Tip 2:

Do you have a part-time business or are you fully self-employed?
Take full advantage of section 179 that allows you to expense
equipment you buy for your business!  The general rule is that a
business can't write-off the whole cost of certain assets in one year.
For example, if your business buys a new computer for $4,000, the
law says that you must spread the tax deduction over five years. With
section 179, you can immediately write-off up to $24,000 of qualifying
property in 2001 instead of taking the depreciation deduction over a
longer period of time. What is qualifying property? For most people,
qualifying property is tangible personal property, such as equipment,
office machinery, and furniture.

Tip 3:
Do you find yourself spending your refund check before it arrives
(even if you're spending it in your mind) and wondering when it is
going to finally arrive? According to the Internal Revenue Service,
the fastest way to get your refund is to file your return electronically.
When you file electronically, you can receive your refund in as little as
10 days, compared to 6 to 8 weeks with a paper return. TurboTax
enables you to electronically file one federal tax return at no cost,
after mail-in rebate. The IRS also recommends that you file your return
early in February or March rather then waiting until mid April.

To avoid delays when filing a paper return, remember to:

1. Sign your return.
2. Make sure that any supporting documents are securely stapled to the
   front of the return.
3. Make sure your mailing address is correct.
4. Have your refund deposited directly into your bank account.

Debt Consolidation - new calculator helps tell if its right for you

Debt-consolidation is a powerful, proven way to cure debt woes,
especially after the holiday season.  Homeowners have the option to
consolidate bills by refinancing or using a home equity loan - both
loans can eliminate high interest rates and roll multiple bills into
one manageable payment all while taking advantage of historically
low mortgage rates.  And for most people the interest may be
tax-deductible.

The idea of debt-consolidation refinancing is simple: use your home's
increased equity to get a lump sum of cash to pay off your
high-interest debts.  To see for yourself and get the facts, visit
Quicken Loans new Debt Consolidation calculator to compare borrowing
costs, calculate payments and tax savings, graph out payment options
and other benefits of consolidating debt through a refinance or home
equity loan.  Be sure to consult your tax advisor for more
information on maximizing your mortgage deductions at tax time.

* Why is Internet Explorer installing on my desktop along with
  TurboTax?

Internet Explorer is installed to allow TurboTax to quickly and
reliably identify your Internet Service Provider(s) and allow you to
connect to the Internet through TurboTax. Access to the Internet is
required to update your product, download your state program, and
file electronically.

* How do I resolve the error message:  "Installation not complete /
  Installation not successful"?

In most cases, you'll need to perform a hard drive installation by
installing TurboTax from the hard disk drive rather than the CD-ROM.
Follow these steps:

1.  Insert the TurboTax CD in your CD-ROM drive. Cancel any messages
    that appear and shut down any Terminate and Stay Resident programs
2.  Start Windows Explorer. Click Start, select Programs, and click
    Windows Explorer.
3.  Create a folder to hold the contents of the TurboTax CD. Click
    the letter for the hard disk drive you are working on to
    highlight it. Go to the File menu and point to New. Click Folder.
    A folder called New Folder appears. Type the word TXINSTL to
    replace the name New Folder and press ENTER.
4.  Find your CD-ROM drive (usually drive letter D) and double-click
    it. A list of files and folders appears in the right side of the
    Windows Explorer screen
