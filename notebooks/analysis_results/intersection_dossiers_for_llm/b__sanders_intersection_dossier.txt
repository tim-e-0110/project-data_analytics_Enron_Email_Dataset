Chris Boehler is the lawyer at A&K who handled the IDB Lease (the one that I gave you a copy of the other day).  Bill Neese is the lawyer for the IDB who worked across the table from Chris.  You might want to get Bill's number from Chris Boehler (Chris' direct lines is 713-220-4421) and give him a call.  I am sure that Bill is worried about who is covering his legal fees.  If memory serves me, the Lease calls for the IDB to be fully indemnified by the lessee (Gleason Power I, L.L.C.).  Please call if you need any further information.

Chris,

As you know, we have all been sued over the alleged vibrations at the
above plant by the Chamberlins.  Who will be handling this for Enron?  I
will contact Allegahny so we can coordinate the defense.

Please review and call me at your earliest convenience.

Subject:	Methodology for Allocating Missed SCE and PGE Payments

As promised, here is my outline of a proposed methodology for allocating the
losses arising from the payments not made to CalPX by SCE and PGE:

1) All participants should be returned to the position they were in before
CalPX issued invoices based on the 90 day charge back provisions in the
tariff.  This will implement the rescission of the 90 day charge back
methodology ordered by FERC.

2) The losses arising from payments not made by a particular buyer for power
purchased during a particular period will be shared pro rata among the
sellers that sold electricity during that period based on the amounts the
sellers are owed for that particular period.

3) The CalPX will not apply any charge back or default allocation to
payments and losses applicable to the real time market for which the CalPX
acts as Scheduling Coordinator.  Instead, CalPX will collect the payments,
if any, and pass them on to the ISO, subject to whatever administrative
charges CalPX is authorized to deduct by the CalPX or ISO tariffs.  Only the
ISO tariff will apply to allocate the losses from payments not made for
power sold and purchased on the real time market.

4) Any payments presently held or hereafter collected and expressly
designated for a particular period and buyer will be applied to the period
and buyer for which such payments are designated.  Any payments presently
held or hereafter collected that are not designated for a particular period
will be applied to the oldest missed payments by the buyer that subsequently
made the payment or on account of which the payment was subsequently
collected.

As I have maintained, this methodolgy may not be perfect for everyone, but,
assuming that it works, it has the appeal of being both simple and
principled.  The CalPX has indicated that it will provide us with feedback
on our approach, but will not formally endorse any particular methodology
because of its concern that it must remain neutral and not appear to support
any group of participants against any other group of participants.

As I have also maintained, until a simple and principled methodology is
adopted, it will be difficult to make any progress with the return of the
letters of credit and the distribution of the funds in the custodial and
escrow accounts.

I believe we should agree upon a workable methodology and then file a motion
with the bankruptcy court on notice to all participants to have the CalPX
authorized and directed to adopt and implement the methodology.  The
participants can then take the order to Judge Moreno to release the letters
of credit and escrowed funds and to FERC to have it formally amend the
tariffs to incorporate the methodology.

Please review the methodology outlined above with your clients so that we
can discuss it in detail during our next conference call.

Thanks.

Subject:	El Paso FERC Case

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT AND OTHER PRIVILEGES

Mark:

I assume that you and Richard are very familiar with the day-to-day developments in the heavily publicized FERC case involving the investigation by FERC of El Paso's sale of pipeline capacity into the CA market to its merchant arm last year that CA officials have partly blamed for the spike in gas and power prices.  As you know, this is the case where the highest executives of El Paso recently were called to testify at FERC.

An article in this morning's New York Times (which begins on page 1), in discussing El Paso's significant earnings generated by the El Paso merchant arm from the pipeline capacity purchase, says that the parties with which El Paso hedged its position also made sizeable profits.  The article notes that about half of El Paso's trades were with Enron "according to people present at the briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials."  While this probably is not surprising in light of our size and breadth in the market, it nonetheless is made to sound somewhat sinister, and my sense is that it is just another potential barb for the CA officials to throw at us.  Since the article quotes a response from Mark Palmer (in which he suggests that Enron, in turn, likely would have resold the capacity and would not have realized the benefit of the rising market), I assumed that you were aware of it, but I thought I would err on the side of putting an extra e-mail in your in-box.

Thanks Richard,

The reason I asked was because our IT people in Houston have told us that we cannot transfer emails that we need beyond the retention period to word documents.  That seemed a bit strange, but they were quite emphatic.   I have clarified the rule with our IT head.

Thanks a lot, and take care,

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

We should waive this.  I waived a similar conflict for Guido last year. He represents us in the Stamp Tax case in Argentina and frequently represents the Bolivian govt.

Dear Michelle, 

The Superintendencia General del SIRESE (Bolivia) just send me the background of the Transredes case in which they are requesting my advise. 

It is an administrative appeal before said agency of resolutions SSDH Nbr. 0257/2000 and 0014/2001 concerning the assesment of a fine of 710.000 bolivianos due to an oil spill and the rejection of the appeal filed before the Hidrocarbons Agency.  

As mentioned in our conference call, I informed the Superintendencia General about my assistance to Enron in different matters and they expressed no concern about the independence of my advise nor potential conflicts of interest. Please be kind enough to confirm me that Enron acknowledges that no conflict of interest arises of my eventual assistance to the Superintendencia General cocerning this matter and, therefore, that it has no objection in order for me to provide such assistance.

I have revised and am emailing to you and Robin a copy of the revised Molland Declaration that I have sent back to Michael this afternoon wherein he explains what happened yesterday regarding the tentative ruling and asks for oral argument. When I spoke to Michael late this afternoon about the declaration I learned some additional information which is contrary to one of our assumptions, and suggests it will be harder to expect the court to go forward with argument on Monday. Through this afternoon(when I had discussed this separately with Richard and Robin today), we have been operating on the assumption that only telephonic notice to opposing counsel of the intent to argue was required to have oral argument in SFO court and that notice to the court itself was not required. If so, the court would have this one on its Monday calendar. I asked Michael again how the Court would know what matters would actually be on the oral argument calendar and was told today that the telephonic instructions from the court which accompany the tentative ruling tell you before listening to the recorded ruling  that apparently YOU HAVE TO PUSH A CERTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBER BUTTON AT THE END OF THE ORAL RULING IF THE MATTER IS TO REMAIN ON CALENDAR FOR ORAL ARGUMENT. That was not done by the person who first called and listened to the ruling for Michael. When someone called back and attempted to do so the response was "invalid" or something to that effect. Presumably that was because it was sometime after the 4:30 deadline. This would suggest that we are not even on the calendar (without a request for oral argument)as we had hoped. I still will be there to argue, or at least argue for a hearing date. I wanted Bob to know of this new info in case it affects his decision on coming out here. Call me on my cell 619-985-9792 any time if anyone has questions. I will be emailing the draft replies for Sacramento tomorrow.

We did not learn of this tentative until after 4:30 today, although it was
probably posted sometime earlier in the afternoon.  The local rule states
that a party who wishes to argue the tentative shall notify opposing counsel
before 4:30. We called their attorneys after 4:30, but before 5 PM. I
reached Martin Goyette, counsel for the AG personally by phone shortly after
five, and notified him of our intention to argue. He claimed the AG would
not appear to argue given late notice. I have notified him by fax of our
intention to argue.

I have a document by someone named Marty Howard, who I believe may be
associated with Portland General. The document was sent to me by Richard
Tabors. According to the email Howard used to work for McCullough.

After a very brief read through, I think it tries to show that the
statistical link between prices in CA and the PNW was WEAK in peak hours. I
suppose they are trying to show that the "contagion" effect from California
show not be an issue? I have some problems from an initial read with the
econometric analysis, but I have not yet reviewed it fully.

However, it also leaves open the very possibility that was discussed earlier
on the call. If there is a refund, and it is based on some notion of "PNW
prices", it could be a very large one. I think we need to consider this
issue quite carefully.

Granite Power Partners 


ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Tom and Mike:

As you may know, NEPCO and the project Owners are named in a personal injury
lawsuit that was served on NEPCO earlier this month in Cook County,
Illinois.  I tender the case by letter to Dick Corp for their defense and
indemnity since it involved one their employees who broke his leg on the
jobsite in Kendall, Illinois.  I cited paragraph 4 (b) and (d) of the JVA as
my authority for shifting the risk to Dick, however was silent on Paragraph
11 and 19 which actually says we should have purchased a GL policy for the
JV to protect the JV and its partners.  As a cost saving measure agreed by
the JV partners, no policy was purchase because each Dick and NEPCO would
rely on the GL policy of their own (Dick's and Enron's) to protect
themselves against third party claims. Paragraph 19 is an indemnity which
states the JV partners share risk 50/50 without respect to who is at fault
except for willful actions.  It also states the JV will indemnify the JV
members, which only works if the JV had purchased a GL policy and in the
absence of a GL policy then the intent would be that each party will utilize
the others GL policy and share in the deductible cost.  Dick has responded
in writing and said it will defend and indemnity NEPCO through its GL policy
(Travelers) but says the JV partners must share in their $250,000
deductible, or $125K per partner.  That hurts, but not as bad as if this
were handled by Enron's policy which has a self insured deductible of $2
Million.

In the end, I agree to some extent with Dick's response for pure third party
claims, but I have some trouble with the concept of claims coming from their
own employees of which they would have immunity from suit under the workers
compensation act.  Dick pays up to it's cap on liability under the WC act
and then theoretically has 50% deductible liability under the GL policy for
claims against the other JV partner.  Had this not been a JV relationship,
we would have had Dick paying all of the defense and indemnity as a
subcontractor.  The JVA is silent on this split in liability for claims by
either parties' own employees, however, I look back to the paragraphs I
cited to Roger Peters (Par. 4 (b) and (d)) and they say with respect to
subcontracts, of which Dick and NEPCO were expected to perform their
respective scopes of work under (see 4 (b)), each such subcontract shall
oblige the subcontractor to indemnify the JV and each of the parties from
and against all expense, liability and claims resulting from its
construction/engineering work.  This language would say that Dick should
take 100% of the claim.  

The bottom line, the JVA is vague in respect to claims by its own employees.
If this were the only claim, I would say lets share the loss because the
benefit and exposure flows both ways.  In reality though, most if not all of
the claims will come from construction workers (Dick employees).  So sharing
the loss is not reasonable especially since the Travelers lawyer has said
the common practice of Union hired employees in the Chicago area is to bring
numerous accident injury claims against owners and GCs as the project winds
down.  He said to expect more claims like this because he sees this on other
Dick jobs.

Gail and Bob,  This message is more for informational purposes since the
claim has been accepted by Dick Corp although Travelers did not afford me
much selection of counsel since they went ahead and assigned it to a Chicago
lawyer, Chic Marasa.  His number and address is:  (312) 345-7229, Law
offices of Chic Marasa, One East Wacker Drive, Suite 3450, Chicago, Illinois
60601.  We may want to have one of you monitor the outside lawyer hired by
Travelers and make sure our interests are served.  I sent the complaint and
my tender letter to Richard Sanders on August 10th.  Gail,  I spoke to Chic
and he sounds nice, single and available if you are interested. Juuust
kidding.

Subject:	Casey, John A. v. Nepco

Mr. Derrick, I am directing this email to your attention at the request of Mr. Jim Bouillion for consideration of extending coverage to Nepco, pursuant to the EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT on our Directors & Officers policy.

We have reviewed the Petition wherein a former iron worker of Nepco alleges damages as a result of being terminated, in violation of Title 85 O.S. d 5.  The Plaintiff sustained an on the job injury on April 6, 2001, when he was struck by a crane.  He received workers compensation benefits.  He allegedly re-injured his back on June 15, 2001.  The Plaintiff alleges that "several hours after notifying his employer of re-injuring his back, Plaintiff was summarily terminated by Defendant."  The "Plaintiff alleges that a significant part of Defendant's decision to terminate him was because of his injury and because he exercised his rights under the Workers Compensation Act."  The Petition goes on to state that the Defendant's actions "were done in reckless disregard for the rights of the Plaintiff and/or were wanton and motivated by oppression, fraud and/or malice" and thus includes a count for punitive damages.  Suit is filed in Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma, with an Answer date of before September 4, 2001.

Our preliminary review of the Petition, absent any independent investigation or knowledge with respect to the allegations and the value placed on same, suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Officers policy.  The definition of "WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE" includes "the actual or constructive termination of a career opportunity, or employment discipline or evaluation in a manner which violates any local, state, or federal law, whether existing by statute or common law, or which breaches any implied contract to continue employment"...It is doubtful this matter would exceed the $1M policy deductible.

Please advise if you would like for us to extent coverage to Nepco.  According to the information provided, the matter has been assigned to Bonnie White of the Litigation Unit and is being overseen by Richard Sanders of ENA.

Subject: York Paper v. Enron/Holzer



Privileged and Confidential

Gail,

I had a productive conversation with Keith Dutill, the Stradley lawyer who
I've known for decades and who is now representing York Paper.

The short of it is that he said he is very interested in trying to resolve
this before the litigation machinery cranks up.  He will discuss it with his
client and get back to me.  He said that York has "strong feelings" and then
agreed with me that Enron feels the same way.  He felt that York has a "good
business sense" and would be interested in reaching a compromise without
spending a lot of dollars in legal fees.

Dutill does not know why two separate summons were filed in Delaware County.
It's his understanding that the claims against Enron are largely the same as
the claims against Holzer (with perhaps one or two exceptions that still
relate to Holzer's employment with Enron).  He is working on a complaint
that will cover both summons, and expects to file it in the next several
weeks, certainly before the mediation conference on November 19th.  I said
that we should try to start our own discussions before that mediation
conference so that the mediator could focus on any areas of disagreement.

Here's how Dutill described York's claims:  Holzer worked for York Paper.
When Holzer left York, York wanted to prevent Holzer from working for Enron.
Holzer wanted to work for Enron, and so did Enron, so there was some
"agreement" between Holzer/Enron and York.  In that "agreement", Holzer and
Enron made "promises" about the way they "would do business" with York.  It
appears that the promise was that Holzer and Enron would not bypass York
Paper and deal directly with York Paper's customers.  Yet, according to
Dutill, that is what Holzer and Enron did -- cut out York Paper as the
middle man.  This has resulted in a "fair erosion of business" for York
Paper.  It is "not just a matter of subsequent solicitation."  It also
involves "interference with existing contracts" between York and its
customers. 

So, it would seem that York's claims might include breach of contract,
interference with contractual relations and, perhaps,
misrepresentation/fraud.  Interestingly, he did not mention any of the West
Coast and Garden State Paper contracts we have been looking into.

If you have any thoughts, please let me know.  I will keep you informed of
any further developments.

	This is another example of litigation involving NEPCO about which 'the litigation group' (me) knew nothing.  I assume David obtained Derrick's approval for counsel (he usually does) but I still wonder what other matters are hiding under the rug that we don't know about.
	Last time we discussed this you mentioned that you wanted us involved in their litigation the same way we would be involved if they were here. Accordingly, should I talk to Dave and find out what else is out there?  This deal is very similar to the last situation wherein NEPCO had filed an arbitration and we didn't find out about it until well after the thing was under way.

Gail,  

I think you are referring to a case between the Oklahoma Dept. of Health and
NEPCO, and yes I have it.  Steve Jantzen of McKinney and Stringer in
Oklahoma City was retained early on when the threat of litigation was
evident.  There was actually an earlier case filed but improperly served on
NEPCO so the court dismissed it.  This is a new case  and repeat of the old
case which has now been properly served on NEPCO.  The case will be stayed
pursuant to a Consent Decree that is being negotiated by NEPCO with the
Dept. of Health concerning compliance with the correct ratio of apprentices
to licensed electricians on the Jenks, OK jobsite.   In fact, this issue
will be moot soon as the project is near completion and all matters of
compliance will be non existent when the workforce is released later this
month.

On the other case for a $2800 collection matter, that is being handled by
Bonnie White and set to be dismissed by the plaintiff on agreement by NEPCO
to pay a compromised amount.  This case should never have happened expect
for the fact that a forwarding address from a closed office in California
never properly forwarded the claimant's invoices to NEPCO

Hi Sheila, 

My partner Donn Pickett has been trying to get Richard Sanders to sign off on the attached conflicts letter concerning our representation of Reliant in the litigation in California in which Enron is also involved.  I understand the letter confirms prior conversations between Richard and Donn.  Karen suggested that, because you see Richard frequently, maybe we could enlist your help in getting the paperwork processed.  We would greatly appreciate that.

I hope all is going well for you and your family.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Please see the message below and let me know whether you would have an interest in visiting with Steve Newton with respect to his idea.  Jim

Jim - 
 
It has been several years since  we've visited, and there are a couple of areas I'd like to update with you  on.  I'm hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again.
 
First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright & Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.
 
Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a "Legal Information Counsel" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.   
 
I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.  
 
I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.  
 
I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.
 
Steve

Attached is a draft of the letter to be sent to ASCC concerning the receivables deal. Tim/Chris, please note that it contemplates a new Monthly Settlement Report. After you have had a chance to review, lets discuss the timing, the dollar figure, and the discussion with the bank.
