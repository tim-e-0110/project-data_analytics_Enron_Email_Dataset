State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Jeff:

Thanks again for all of your time and consideration with respect to our consideration of Norm Pedersen to join our Firm in Los Angeles.  I just wanted to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue things further with Norm.  After drilling down even further, it just seemed like we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based upon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the nature of Norm's historical client base.  It also would not have been fair to Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he had planned to pursue at the Firm.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the situation.  I really felt bad bothering you with this, but I knew you would have the best insights into the likely direction of the regulatory proceedings in CA and I wanted to make sure that I was being fair in evaluating Norm's situation and in a position to make a decision based on all of the relevant facts.  I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use those words together!) that I do not want you to think or feel that you "nixed" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.  In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a sense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has been pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-starter since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other side from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.  It is one thing to receive a waiver to represent another company in a negotiated commercial transaction in which Enron is relying on another law firm, but I could not see us pressing a regulatory agenda directly adverse to Enron's interests in a proceeding in which Enron was a major participant and which we knew going into the proceedings at the start that our representation would be adverse to Enron.

As Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have been adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see "eye to eye" with Enron on all of the issues.  These generally have been situations involving historical client relationships that go back decades where Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been incredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those proceedings.  Nonetheless, I am trying to do whatever I can to try to eliminate or reduce the number of those situations on a going forward basis, although I know I will not be able to eliminate all of them in light of the size of our Firm and the diverse nature of its client base.

Jeff, I will follow up with you personally, but I just wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you for the time and thought you devoted to this.   I'm sure we will be speaking soon on some CA regulatory matter or the other.

John

I love it.  Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.  If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., "Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for"), it would really bring the house down.  But I think that ENA would get damn queasy about doing it.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years.

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

This looks very good.  One suggestion:  May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.  May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).  Just a suggestion.  I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.  Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.

That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).

I was assuming that Paul would facilitate.  Paul can you make this meeting? If not Paul, I was assuming it would be Sue or you.

Here's my  suggested Agenda

1. Clarify scope of meeting.  Calif. coverage or the entire West?

2. GA staff goes down the list of key cases that affect the curve (T, D, and utility G) and identifies who's covering cases

3. URM gives feedback on areas of their curves that may not be in GA's "radar"

4. Discussion over which cases should be monitoring mode and which we should be advocating a position.

Subject: FW: CPUC Press Conference -- Lynch announces will vote against the
 DWR Rate agreement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT RATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUC AND DWR


The Bond Structure
? Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of
the bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power
purchase revenues and no other repayment source.
? Designed as a "net revenue bond," meaning bondholders are paid last and
all other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.  In order to sell net
revenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1)
carry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off
the bonds.  As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the
overall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the
overall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by
ratepayers for 15 years.
? Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in
place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least
the next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will
generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs
for the life of the bonds.  
? Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the
bonds are outstanding.


The Rate Agreement
? Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends
over a revenue requirement.  The Commission is limited only to correcting
mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.  If the
Commission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue
calculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates
established at a level that satisfies DWR.
? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power
and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the
utilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each
service territory. 
? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of
their customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the
state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the
requirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whatever
revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in
the power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.  
? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to
change the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program "sunset" at the
end of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern about
this provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested
that an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to
continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through
Commission-approved revenue requirements.
? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state
during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being
exercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals
will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the
State.
? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term
contracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of those
contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would
not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that
would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts.
? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and
collect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for
failure to pay for electricity provided by DWR.
? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter
or modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likely
need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remains
in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds
are issued.   


The Challenges to the Rate Agreement
? Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement.
? Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the State
Treasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction.
? Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement,
including:
	o The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR's
revenue requirement 
	o Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law,
and outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power  
	o DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegal
because they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWR
Oppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has the
physical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution
networks.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 

"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 

The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 

The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 

CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. 

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

THE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS
All faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20. This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. 

The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.

Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.

Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address. 

Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. 

Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops. Panels planned for this year's conference include: 
+ Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate 
+ Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World 
+ International Business 
+ Wild Women 

This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

Subject: PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:Part 2:  PUC Approves Edison Bailout

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
10/02/2001



GOVERNOR MAKES STATEMENT ON PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ACTIONS 10/2/2001


SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis today made the following statement regarding PUC
actions:

"I applaud the mutual efforts of the California Public Utilities Commission
and Southern California Edison. Their settlement has protected the public
interest, and will allow the State's second largest utility to return to
financial health. I am pleased to hear the PUC's assurance that this can be
accomplished without a rate hike.

"In light of the agreement between the PUC and Edison, there is no need for
the Legislature to return next week for a special session. Therefore, I am
rescinding my call for the Third Extraordinary Session.

"In January, the Legislature passed AB 1X which authorized the State to
purchase power since our two largest utilities were brought to their
financial knees by runaway wholesale energy costs. Despite long odds, the
State was able to keep the lights on this summer and has spent approximately
$6.1 billion from the General Fund and $5 billion from the DWR Power Fund
doing so. AB 1X envisioned the sale of revenue bonds to repay the General
Fund with interest.

"The Public Utilities Commission's refusal today to adopt the rate agreement
necessary for the bonds to be sold was an irresponsible act. It creates
uncertainty about our ability to sell the bonds necessary to repay the
General Fund when California can least afford additional fiscal uncertainty.
In fact, preliminary financial estimates show that State revenues are $1.1
billion short of budget projections.

Report critical of California's energy deals

By Toby Eckert
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
October 3, 2001

WASHINGTON -- A new congressional report is adding to the mounting
criticism of California's foray into the purchase of electricity.
The Congressional Budget Office study warns that Californians could pay
a steep price for the long-term contracts negotiated by the state, given
a recent decline in electricity prices. It also faults the lack of
independent oversight of the state's power deals.
"If the state cannot recover all of its electricity-related costs
through retail prices, California taxpayers will have to make up the
difference. . . . The state may be at risk of creating a major
government-subsidized industry -- an industry that private suppliers
could be at a disadvantage in competing against," the report says.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis could not be reached for comment on the
report. But the administration has noted that while the contract prices
appear high now, they are significantly lower than what electricity
sellers were charging at the height of the power crisis, when many of
the contracts were negotiated.
The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency that explores
major economic issues for Congress. The concerns the budget office
raised about the state's electricity purchases are part of a 43-page
report on the power crisis that gripped California for more than a year
as wholesale electricity costs skyrocketed.
The report cites numerous flaws in the state's attempt to deregulate the
power market and also raises the possibility that power sellers
intentionally withheld supplies to raise prices.
To stem the crisis and avert blackouts, the state Department of Water
Resources started buying power on behalf of financially battered
utilities in January. The crisis has abated, but the state has come
under intense criticism from consumer groups that say it spent far too
much on the power purchases, which total more than $40 billion.
The budget office report echoes those concerns and faults the state for
moving further away from a workable competitive power market.
"California's actions represent a blunt solution to the problems of
insecure supply and volatile prices -- a solution that ultimately may
present the state with many of the same problems that (power market)
restructuring was intended to solve," the report says.
It also cites a "lack of transparency" and oversight of the state's
power purchases.
The California Public Utilities Commission recently asked federal
regulators to review the power contracts and determine whether the
prices are reasonable.
The budget office report broke no new ground on the origins of the power
crisis, attributing it to a combination of factors that have been cited
in other studies. They include a flawed attempt to deregulate
California's power market, a lack of adequate power generation in the
state and a spike in the cost of natural gas, which is used to fuel many
power plants.
The report said it was "also possible that individual sellers tacitly
colluded to withhold supplies in order to push prices above competitive
levels," a charge repeatedly leveled by Davis and consumer groups.
"However," the budget office concluded, "evidence about how much, if
any, capacity was withheld for competitive rather than legitimate
operational reasons is unclear."

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Subject: Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International. 
"We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." 
Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. 
Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. 
The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. 
Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. 
"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." 
Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. 
Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." 
"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," Bryson said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." 
Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate. 
     
Stephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. 
Bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt. 
The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. 
"In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. 
The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. 
Bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC. 
     
Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. 
The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said. 
The end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.

Don't hate me for sending a note.  What do you think?
"California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."
"Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."

Listening to the Edison call w/investors
Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02.
My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims.
Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets 



(Published Oct. 7, 2001) 

A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. 

Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. 

Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. 

Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. 

The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. 

Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. 

How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. 

However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. 

It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. 

The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"

State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal
Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.
SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.

With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.

Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.

Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."

Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.

Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.

And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.

For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.

Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as "nonexistent."

But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.

Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."

A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.

Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.

She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing."

"Before, I was on [Davis'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."

Critics, including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.

Insisting on Independence

Accounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.

Starting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison, Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. Davis had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.

Lynch was another skeptic; Davis' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate Edison. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.

Davis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill.

The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.

Lynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edison's debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers.

It was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.

"When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.

At her direction, PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison.

Edison, PUC Started Secret Talks

Edison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.

But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.

The PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."

Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edison's problem.

Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with Edison.

"If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."

For several days, however, Lynch did not inform Davis. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.

On Sept. 25, some of Davis' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.

That same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.

Over the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.

"It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney Ron Olson, an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.

While those negotiations were going on, Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.

The issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers.

Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.

The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque.

The governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.

But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson.

Commissioners Praise Lynch

In Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.

"There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.

Brown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.

"She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of Davis' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.

"I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Subject: Conspiracy?:  Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield
 the governor?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. 
All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. 
When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. 
Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. 
At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. 
Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. 
Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. 
A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. 
That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. 
By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. 
Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. 
Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.

 manipulation?

Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement." 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a year." 
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.

Subject: FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another defeat for Davis.  Tough break.  Is the judge's proposed decision available?

FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . 
The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. 
"While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. 
In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. 
"El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded. 
"There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. 
FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. 
The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. 
"The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said. 
 
     Contracting With Affiliates 
   
At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. 
California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. 
The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. 
The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. 
But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power." 
The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. 
From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. 
Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power. 
 
     Improper Communications Seen 
   
Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. 
Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. 
Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. 
Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. 
Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. 
El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. 
The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. 
However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court.

Subject: California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says;
 DWR Contract Renegotiation Is Key
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. 
Davis `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''

Subject: PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. 
Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. 
The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. 
The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. 
The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. 
It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. 
EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM 
One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. 
Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. 
The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. 
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. 
Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. 
Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 
'FIRE SALE PRICES' 
"PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. 
"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. 
Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. 
PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. 
The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. 
They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. 
The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. 
SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. 
Davis `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''

Subject: Davis devises new borrowing plan 


Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and
bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the
long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California
state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy
crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as
next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator,
the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it
declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in
place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the
repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining
issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday
when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different
scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be
publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell
$12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would
go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a
mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before
they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and
cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from
ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove
inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to
the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the
department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole
responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that
authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its
president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure
investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would
be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers'
utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect,
guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with
paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe
that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest
negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an
executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate
agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"
Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the
PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of
those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his
expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the
payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by
Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in
getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies'
contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis
believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next
year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by
some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion
shortfall in other income.

deepthroat is rather provocative, don't you think?

Hey, whatever you're doing, keep it up!  I don't know how you moved the stock from 24 to 37, and I don't care.  Keep it up!

Subject:	Conversation w/Jerry Hirsch of LA Times

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Subject: Edison pact could point way for PG&E
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interesting.  What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks.
Best,

Edison pact could point way for PG&E 
The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. 
It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. 
The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. 
Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. 
One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. 
From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. 
It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. 
"It's definitely ambiguously worded," said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. 
"There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers," Linsey said. 
The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. 
In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. 
And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. 
About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. 
Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. 
The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. 
Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. 
"In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers," said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. 
But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. 
No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? 
Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. 
The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. 
"People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. "It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'" 
The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. 
That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. 
They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. 
"They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. 
For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. 
"I think it would be smarter to be talking now," he said. 
A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. 
Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. 
"We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power," Cohen said. 
Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. 
Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. 
At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. 
It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. 
"It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this," said Florio, the consumer advocate. "This could be the beginning of something really ugly." 
In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.

I think that we should pursue both.  If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.  If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.  Thoughts?

We went into the FERC proceeding believing that the Chief ALJ was not
likely to give us a good decision.  During the course of the proceeding, we
convinced ourselves that he would rule our way due to the vast evidence in
our favor and the relatively inept presentation of El Paso and El Paso
Merchant Energy.  Well, despite the voluminous record in support of our
position, the judge ruled that it was "not at all clear" that El Paso
exercised market power.  The good news for your affiliates is that, if the
Commission does not find the exercise of market power in this case, it
never will.  We hope when the Commission reviews the entire record,
including the "protected material", they will change the ALJ's finding.  On
some level we believe that the ALJ just does not like California.  He is
the judge, after all, who told Harold Ray in the electric generation
settlement discussions that he was "an asshole".  The ironic part of the
decision is that we felt that a determination by the ALJ that defined the
market in such a way as to preclude EPME having market power would be
difficult to overcome at the Commission level.  Instead, he defined the
market as we suggested and found that El Paso had market power; he simply
failed to be convinced that they were withholding capacity despite the fact
that they utilized their capacity 54% of the time when everyone else was
utilizing their own capacity at a capacity factor of between 85% and 90%.
Go figure.

I am still less than enchanted with the NGS settlement  after SoCalGas
tailored it to their interests but am glad that the Commission is at least
considering opening up the system ala PG&E.   I think that they are
reasonably aware that SoCalGas was not blameless in the runup in gas prices
that took place last December.   Having said that we are having a hell of a
time in the GCIM simply trying to investigate what really happened.
SoCalGas latest excuse for not giving us info is that we will "competitors"
with them (as a result of the filed rate litigation) for gas hedges.  I
must have misunderstood; I did not realize there was a limited supply of
hedges available and that there was competition for those "available"
hedges.   Anytime Enron wants to help on these GCIM issues, we would
welcome it--might make you look less like a Texas robber baron.

Playboy Online staff cutbacks

Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in 
its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As 
part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media 
company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. 
Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six 
months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its 
service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can 
look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we 
look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it 
well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.

On another "food for thought" note.  Eldon and Nancy:  Here's the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on "just wars."  Sort of thought-provoking.

October 11, 2001
Commentary
Even Pacifists Must
Support This War

By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."

Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.

Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.

I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.
But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.

It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.

Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.

This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.

In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."

Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.

In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.

And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?

Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.

But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.
Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.

What do you think about this?  It seems to me that, while I don't at this
point vote either way, there is another factor in the equation that I don't
see mentioned.  What if you also  hypothesize that those identified people
are going to die anyway?  We have pretty good evidence that some of the
people on the plane that went down in Pennsylvania were thinking this way.

Issue 40, Volume 3 

A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento

ECONOMIC SUMMIT 

In the wake of repeated economic blows on the state's business community and announcements of losses, layoffs and declining tax revenues, the Governor has stated his intention to hold an Economic Summit in early November with business and labor leaders, and professional economists to identify and discuss measures to stimulate California's economy.   The date and participants will be announced this week.  Governor Davis is also considering the possibility of calling a Special Legislative Session to enact such measures immediately.   In an effort to avoid or minimize a looming State budget deficit, the Department of Finance has instructed state agencies to cut their budgets by 15%. 

CMTA's members are devising a priority list of policies that should be adopted to help mitigate the effects of the international economic cooling and hopefully, stave-off recession in this state. 

POWER AUTHORITY MEETING 

Renewables and the Power Authority 
At an October 5 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) meeting in San Francisco, Chairman David Freeman acknowledged that renewable peaking capacity may comprise a significant portion of the 15 percent reserve the Authority expects to establish to prevent future price spikes in the cost of electricity. 

Freeman indicated that the Authority has received proposals for 18,000 MW in peaker capacity, which have been evaluated and winnowed down to 3,000 MW.  While commitments to build these peaker facilities have not yet been formalized, the Power Authority is moving forward with proposals for a few hundred renewable megawatts. 

Freeman also indicated that at least two state biomass plants are at risk of shutting down.  He believes that these plants should continue to run, despite the high costs associated with this market.  Power Authority staff has been asked to look at options to keep the plants operating, and to report back to the Power Authority. 

Board member Donald Vial expressed concern at the way in which the Power Authority is looking at the 15 percent reserve.  He believes that the reserve should be a working capacity margin used to phase out dirty plants and to move into, and to promote renewables. 

Board member John Stevens pointed out that the Power Authority has limited funding with which to purchase peaking capacity, and reminded the members that any plan must reasonably balance the costs associated with the generation capacity. 

Department of Water Resources Update 
The Power Authority also received a report from staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR) who indicated that the Department is looking at load curtailment, renewables and new supplies that ideally are north of Path 15.  The Department believes it has been instrumental in keeping the spot market under control and minimizing the number of blackouts experienced this summer.  The Department also gave a great deal of credit to customers who have been instrumental in preventing blackouts through conservation. 

The Department will be updating its energy portfolio needs, and posting its information on its website at www.cers.water.ca.gov, sometime next week. 

Public Utilities Commission Natural Gas Infrastructure Report 
Barbara Hale, the Director of Strategic Planning at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) provided an update on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report that is due to the Power Authority by November 15.  Ms. Hale indicated that the PUC is working with the California Energy Commission (CEC) to evaluate the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure, including interstate pipelines, intrastate pipelines, local distribution, storage and backbone.  The PUC fully expects to have the report finalized and ready to deliver to the Power Authority by November 15. 

Preliminary findings indicate that in-ground storage is at 85 percent of capacity, a healthy margin to meet demands through the winter.  While there still is room to inject additional natural gas, the PUC is expecting a moderate winter with low gas demand. 
Chairman Freeman requested that the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report also include a forecast of natural gas availability from the lower 48 states and Canada, as well as whether or not California may depend on these sources to meet its needs. 

Board Member Vial questioned if the unbundling of storage has been successful.  Ms. Hale replied that the PUC is monitoring non-core use, and that preliminary findings indicate that many non-core customers are increasing their use of storage. 

Activities Related to Renewable Energy and Conservation 
Staff at the Power Authority reported that coordination between the PUC and the Power Authority is necessary to optimize conservation, energy efficiency, and demand response.  Specifically, the Power Authority is putting together a residential loan program; financing for efficiencies in public buildings; and, financing for small commercial and industrial upgrades.  The Power Authority believes that the small commercial and industrial market is the most under-served, due to the multiple demands on owners and their lack of resources.  The Power Authority is looking at ways to assist these customers in retrofitting their facilities. 

At the other end of the spectrum, the Power Authority believes that large commercial and industrial customers require the least assistance.  The Power Authority believes these customers are well served under current programs, but acknowledged that many of the demand response programs would be better coordinated under the administration of just one agency. 

Finally, Board Member Vial questioned why there has been little emphasis on real time pricing.  Power Authority staff agreed that real time pricing has not been a priority, and that the infrastructure to implement a real time pricing program does not currently exist.  Staff did indicate, however, that a recent $35 million investment in meters should help to incentivize these programs. 

Freeman concluded that it is important for the Power Authority to build on the momentum of conservation, and he acknowledged that technology finally is being priced such that real time pricing makes sense and likely will be an integral part of the Power Authority's program. 

Laura Doll Named as New Executive Director 
Laura Doll of Austin, Texas was approved as the Chief Executive Officer of the Power Authority at the October 5 Board meeting.  Most recently, Doll was Director of Customer Service for Grande Communications.  She also has held the positions of Senior Vice President for Planergy, as well as Chief Administrative Officer for Austin Energy.  Doll received a master of public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin, and a bachelor of arts degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  She will receive an annual salary of $200,000. 

COMPUTER RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY BILL VETOED (AGAIN) 

Governor Davis vetoed SB 147 by Senator Debra Bowen (D-Marina Del Rey) on October 8.  The bill would have required employers to prepare and distribute by hard copy or electronically, a company monitoring policies and practices notice to each employee, to collect and verify their understanding of the notice, and file and maintain each employee's signed notice indefinitely.  This is the third time Senator Bowen's notice bill has been vetoed by the Governor and we hope that the bill has struck out. 

In his veto message, the governor referred to some of the concerns expressed by employers such as the need to monitor and control the use of company property for business purposes.  Also employers are potentially liable for the misuse of computers for improper purposes, such as sexual harassment, defamation and the like, so employers have a legitimate reason to monitor e-mail and computer files from time to time. 

The Governor said in closing his veto message, " I support reasonable privacy protections for employees in the workplace and my Administration proposed amendments which would carry out the intent of the bill without imposing undue regulatory burdens and potential legal exposure to businesses for doing what any employee should assume is the employer's right when they accept employment.  Senator Bowen rejected the proposed amendments. Thus, I must veto the bill a third time." 

This is a significant victory for employers.  The bill had the potential to open up Pandora's box on employee notices in the workplace by greatly expanding the scope, confirmation and tracking of notices.  CMTA applauds the Governor's veto of SB 147. 

GOVERNOR SIGNS MERCURY LEGISLATION 

Governor Davis has signed legislation to place new controls on products containing mercury.  SB 633 by Senator Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) places new controls on the disposal of appliance and vehicle components found to contain mercury. 

"I am signing this bill because it will help reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded thermometers, novelty products, and by mercury-containing electrical switches that are not removed before junked vehicles are crushed or shredded," said Davis. 

SB 633 also bans the sale of new automobiles in California after January 1, 2005 that contain mercury electrical switches. 
  

LATE BREAKING NEWS: 

SB 71 (Burton D-San Francisco), Workers' Compensation, vetoed by the Governor.

check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)

Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.

It was a great weekend. Mellow and raging at the same time. Thanks for 
coming. I'm glad you had a good time with everyone as well, including people 
you hadn't hung out with before. The abalone diving was great, even if I 
can't seem to get one now.

It was $100 for each couple for everything. But you got a lot of people onto 
the reef, so if you want to take that off the bill, that's fine, too.

I guess I'll see you tonight? The chefs are going to cook something up. By 
the way, we stopped in Graton yesterday and went to Scala (because Willow 
was closed, to my utter dismay). But Scala was damn good. We had the Dutton 
Pinot, which was great. I had a homemade ravioli that really hit the spot.

See you later,

Scott

P.S. I agree with everything that guy said in the article you sent out. 
Pacifism is just not feasible in most situations. The world can be too 
selfish and evil for something so extreme to be effective more than 15% of 
the time. We have to go after those motherfuckers. And then be very 
responsible in the aftermath.

Jerry,

First off I would like to again commend you on your presentation yesterday.  It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.

As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.  The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.  As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.  I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.  I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.  Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.

Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Mike

Hi Jeff:
 
1.    Don't know at this point what if anything we'll do.  We haven't, as you undoubtedly seen, taken a lead on DA issues.  We do, however, have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be. More when that develops.
 
2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.  He typically works with the QFs who have contracts to sell power; I work more on the consumer side with the QFs who build primarily to self-serve.    (In other words, he looks more a power generation, I look more at end-user issues.)  Certainly feel free to call him.  He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe he'll be here tomorrow.
 
Hope you're safe and well.

Hi Evie:
 
Two quick things:
 
1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?
 
2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.
 
Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.
 
Best,
Jeff

1.	Yes, very likely.

2.	415.421.4143

3.	I've been faced with implementing DA deals this last week.  I've heard
two marketers say that there will be no "exit fees" -- i.e., no
responsibility for utility debt or past or forward DWR costs.  Is this a
commonly held view (or fantasy) among marketers?

1.    Don't know at this point what if anything we'll do.  We haven't,
as you undoubtedly seen, taken a lead on DA issues.  We do, however,
have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be.
More when that develops.

2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.  He typically works with the QFs who
have contracts to sell power; I work more on the consumer side with the
QFs who build primarily to self-serve.    (In other words, he looks more
a power generation, I look more at end-user issues.)  Certainly feel
free to call him.  He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe
he'll be here tomorrow.

Hope you're safe and well.

Hi Evie:

Two quick things:

1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for
rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of
appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC
erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and
that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right
before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done
getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to
re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing
anything?

2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas,
but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether
that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same
folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.

Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

1.	Yes, very likely.

2.	415.421.4143

3.	I've been faced with implementing DA deals this last week.  I've
heard
two marketers say that there will be no "exit fees" -- i.e., no
responsibility for utility debt or past or forward DWR costs.  Is this a
commonly held view (or fantasy) among marketers?

I have a mandolin lesson at 11am on Saturday, which I can't miss because Tom 
is teaching me less these days. That means I can be up in Napa for a 2 pm 
tee-off. Or, we can play on Sunday at 1 or so, after the first set of games? 
Or earlier, if you want. How does that sound? Let me know.

Hi Glen:
Good call this AM.  Mike Day is in fact writing some comments on behalf of Wild Goose and there may be some interest from other folks to sign on and file jointly.  However, Mike won't have something to look at before COB tomorrow, and it's unclear at this point how many folks might sign on.  So I think it's prudent to continue drafting TW's comments.  As soon as I get something from Mike Day, I'll forward to you so you folks can review.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	FW: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

Howdy Golfers,

Tee times have been arranged on the East Course (18 holes of golf) at the Broadmoor for Thursday, November 8 (tee times: 1:40pm & 1:48pm).  The price for playing this course is actually $90; slightly cheaper than what is indicated below.  I have arranged for each of your golf charges to be charged to your individual rooms.  Please refer to the list below for additional charges such as, clubs & shoe charges.   I'm hoping to finalize all the activity choices by the end of the week, so please confirm by COB tomorrow Thursday, October 18 that your activity choice will remain golf.

Thanks!

yes, they already told Dan Douglas they would sign a stipulation that
replaced the MOU wit the Edison-CPUC settlement.  That is more than doable.
Dan is drafting the new stipulation now.  The stipulation commits SCE to pay
once the conditions precedent are met:  1. implementation of the settlement,
and 2. approval of the advice letter on prospective calculation of the
generation credit.  Our only current beef with that is that they exclude the

Thank you for your prompt reply. I have taken the time to listen to all of
your concerns and have responded below appropriately. 

Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a
"desire" (something that, according to my buddhism class yesterday, would be
beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness). The desire,
however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in
diving locations during my honeymoon. Due to the limited amount of vacation
time I am alotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to
forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this
week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the
specified time to obtain the coveted certification. No, I am not interested
in getting certified in Monterey Bay. 

Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round. I
know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras. I hope to provide you with a more deailed answer after consulting
reliable travel guides and weather almanacs. 

Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it). I
have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, jessica, who
just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both
information and endorsements. Yes, Belizeis supposed to be very good also,
but the island we would be going to is practcally in Belize. Please refer to
a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 

I apprecieate your questions and coments and await your reply. 

Sincerely,

Cameron

Interesting.  

Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really
need to get certified for diving."

Question 2: How hot is it down there?

Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to
dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz)
where the diving is supposed to be killer?

I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and
new
years this year.  I really need to get certified for diving and the
diving
there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all
PADI).  PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with
me.
So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing.  Then,
if
you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying
down
there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the
flight would be the most expensive).  And, last, do you have miles on
continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also?  I
think
Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city.  So,
you
might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad.
What do you think?

You're right about the secondary market.  The Commission imposes a 120%
limit on everyone.  The problem is, this is unenforceable.  Marketers will
just bundle transportation with commodity and inflate the commodity price to
extract the transportation premium.  This happened a few ago on the
interstates when FERC tried the same thing.

Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

Subject: The Gas Settlement that Wouldn't Die


Folks:
Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with
SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks
feel about it generally.  Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners 


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments: 

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Subject: RE: I. 99-07-003  Draft Comments on the Revised Proposed Decision
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the
price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is
simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it
will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even
sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the
secondary market.)

Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision
based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.

But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been
on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy
and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that
it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on
record against them.

That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud
support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the
cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.
Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are
ill-advised?

Best,
Jeff

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

Jeff,

In general, I agree with you that absent market power price caps are bad
policy.  In this case, I believe we have crafted the settlement (and the
decision reinforces those sections, in fact, the reduction of market
concentration limits from 40% to 30% goes even further in this regard), so
that market power will not be a problem.  I have phoned Mike Day and
suggested that he craft his comments to include the caveat about market
power, and he indicated that would not be a problem.  With that change I
don't think we object to including the comments on price caps.  I am still
getting approval from the various powers that be, but hope to get that
soon.

Michael

Testimony 

        Jeanne,  I understand from Keith Melville that you were looking for 
various pieces of SDG&E's May 18, 2001 filing in our Revenue Shortfall 
Surcharge Application (A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044).  I have included in the 
attached note the entire SDG&E filing.  Hopefully, you will be able to find 
in the package the information/data you are seeking.  Recognize that there 
were some corrections made on the stand by some of the witnesses.  I would 
recommend that you check the transcript for those corrections. 

        Also, Keith tells me you also wanted a copy of Exhibit #38.  Jim Hay

will send it to you in a separate e-mail. 

        Please let us know, if you need further documents in this 
proceeding.  Have a great day!

Subject:        FW: Reply of SDG&E to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling of August 15,
2001 in A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044 

Attached is the first of three emails with SDG&E's filing  updating the DWR
revenue requirements.   The following is an excerpt from our pleading.  In
the next email are scenarios that show DWR surcharge (cents per kWh for
system, large customers, and small customers)  under assumptions requested
by the ALJ.    

Thanks especially to Ed Fong, Mohamed Derbas, Bill Saxe, Mike Strong, Keith
Melville, and Jeff Parrot for key assistance in getting this filing out in
one-day. 

Based on this filing,  the Commission may (we have no Proposed Decision yet)
rule as soon as August 23 on an increase to SDG&E rates of approximately
3-cents to recover the updated DWR revenue requirements.  

If you have questions, please contact me, Lynn Van Wagenen, or Keith
Melville. 

Excerpt of SDG&E pleading: 

	On August 15, 2001, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Wetzell issued an
"ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S RULING ON THE AUGUST 7, 2001 REVENUE REQUIREMENT
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES" directing San Diego Gas & Electric
Company (SDG&E) to produce updated estimates, including supporting analyses,
of the system average electric rate increases required based on the revised
revenue requirements determined by the Department of Water Resources' (DWR),
as set forth in the August 7, 2001 DWR communication to the California
Public Utilities Commission.

This and the following two e-mails contain the updated information requested
by ALJ Wetzell in his Ruling dated August 15, 2001.  The documents are
spread out over three e-mails because they consist primarily of
spreadsheets.   In this first e-mail SDG&E attaches its pleading responding
to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling along with two documents providing the assumptions
SDG&E used for its updates to Exhibits 14 and 18 and  a document providing a
summary of all of SDG&E's updated analyses.  In the second e-mail SDG&E will
provide its updates to Exhibit 14 and in the third e-mail SDG&E will provide
its updates to Exhibit 18.

State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter


Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

"Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers." 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

"The PUC first gave Edison their bailout," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place." 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

"If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts." 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

"I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.

Sue- 
FYI- we issued the attached release this morning. I know our govt affairs teams will have lots of questions and will probably be asked several questions.  Unfortunately, given the legal nature of this inquiry, we cannot say anything more than this at this time.  We are asking our folks not to engage in conversations or opinion related discussions about this.  Also, Ken Lay will be discussing this at an employee meeting tomorrow morning.  It would be a good idea for everyone to tune in, if possible (or review the playback later in the day.) 

I am also attaching a brief INTERNAL Q&A about the SEC request- just to give a little more information.

Thanks-
Meredith

Subject: Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension
 Date
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

Related Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at
Enron

By Stephen Taub

The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a
prepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." 

Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC
filings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. 

As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall
Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses. 


REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED
Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial
Times. 

Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues
climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. 

The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of
its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the
first half of this year. 

"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley told
the FT. 

Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through August 31. 

Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local
currency terms, according to the paper. 

Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt
covenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS 
Friday, October 19, 2001
[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need." 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

Related Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at
Enron

By Stephen Taub

The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a
prepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." 

Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC
filings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. 

As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall
Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses. 


REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED
Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial
Times. 

Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues
climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. 

The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of
its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the
first half of this year. 

"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley told
the FT. 

Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through August 31. 

Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local
currency terms, according to the paper. 

Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt
covenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

Jeff
CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.

Subject:	Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Best,
Jeff

Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful or not?  Two things occur to me.  First, it is not becoming for a commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of industry -- particularly if you're a Democrat.  Second, it has always struck me that what she needs is some form of record support, not political pats on the back in one-page letters.  I am asking you these questions not judging the proposal to send a letter .... but I've never understood what they're supposed to do for her and I honestly would like to understand.

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as

From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.

Subject:	Socal Window Meeting

\Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

You aren't supposed to be hungry.  Dinner won't be served until 10pm.  Be
hungry at 10.

We leave for NY on the 1st and return on the 11th.  Staying at the Waldorf
the entire time.

Three dates.  OK.  Wait.  How about two dates?  November 15th (any time) or
November 22nd  (any time)??

I think the menus will be good also.  I think my mom has had their food and
liked it too.

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change,
modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one
works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the
riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe
you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK,
of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the
event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other
stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

Jeff

Have you heard anything back on potential dates to meet.  I am in NY
until
November 11th, so any date after that would be great!

Sorry you couldn't watch the movie last night - it was pretty funny.

Hope you are excited about the meat pie for dinner.  Won't that be a

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Re: QF Presentation


Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE "DISPATCHABLE."

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?
PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.)  IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING.

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE.  HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED.

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

YES.

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED.

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST.  THEY ARE A MYTH.  THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE.

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

THAT'S A GOOD THING.  AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS.

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.  AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF.  LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts?

Yeah.  Guess we do have to worry about that.   I was thinking it would apply to our receivable, not the total under collection, but that would not make sense.  Maybe the other idea will work.  It gets difficult to continue to think of ways around some of these problems.  Thanks,

Mike, Jeanne and Bob....the draft looks good...I have noted a few possible
changes and one question.  Let's discuss at your convenience.
 
With regard to interest, APSES asked for an audit.  Why don't we at least
ask for interest and use it at least as a trading point to get the
calculation after Jan. 18 pinned down.

Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter
 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.

Circuit Breaker: Enron Dumps CFO Amid Conflict Questions

By Stephen Taub

Enron Corp. is set to replace CFO Andrew Fastow. As CFO.com reported in a
story earlier this week, Fastow's role in a limited partnership has raised
concerns about a conflict of interest. 

Fastow is succeeded by Jeff McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and
CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was
Enron's treasurer. He resigned that post in part because he disapproved of
Fastow's role in running two partnerships, according to The Wall Street
Journal. 

"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as
CFO," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO, in a statement. 

McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office
as CFO for the company's European operations. Upon returning to the United
States, McMahon assumed the post of EVP of finance and treasurer for Enron
Corp. In 2000, he was named president and COO of Enron Net Works, where he
focused on E-commerce activities. 

As reported on Friday, The Wall Street Journal said a limited partnership
organized by Fastow, who has been Enron's CFO since 1997, racked up millions
of dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company. 

On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

On October 16, Enron stunned Wall Street when it announced that it would
take a $1.01 billion after-tax charge for the September 30 quarter. 

Since the announcement, Enron's share price has more than halved. 

Fastow's dismissal seems to be an about-face for Enron. In a conference call
Tuesday, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to
assure that there was no conflict as Fastow played both roles. Enron has
since dissolved the partnerships. 

"Obviously, the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there
would be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed
certain methods for it to be dealt with ... so Enron would never be
compromised," Lay said in published accounts. "We are very concerned [at]
the way Andy's character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles,
as well as the company's reputation." 

Predictably, on Wednesday at least two law firms - Stull, Stull & Brody and
Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, L.L.P - filed class-action suits against
Enron, Lay, Fastow, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief
executive who resigned in August. 

The suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information
that materially misstated the company's condition and prospects to the
investing public. Moreover, the suits argue that the company failed to
disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not
misleading. 

The complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning
its business, financial results, and operations which failed to disclose,
among other things: 

* The company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining
demand for bandwidth, and the company's efforts to create a trading market
for bandwidth were not meeting with success, as many of the market
participants were not creditworthy. 

* The company's operating results were materially overstated, since Enron
failed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with
certain limited partnerships - the partnerships that were managed by Fastow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jim:
Let Jeremy know that there will be some big dogs (i.e., large customers) coming out with guns a'blazin' on this and that we're working closely with them.

Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.  The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.  Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?

Best,
Jeff

Sue -

Received your voice mail.  Having AReM only file is ok with me.  Spoke with Lamar Frazier - Jeremy sounds worried.  Let's make sure that the contract question is vetted with internal and external lawyers - agree not to give CPUC any info.

Thanks,

I took the plunge and got LASIK about a month ago. 
Amazing to be without glasses or contacts for the
first time in 20 years.  VERY convenient.  

Although some people tell me they miss the specs on

You see this?  What the hell is with Cramer?


    Date      October 25, 2001
    Time      07:00 AM - 08:00 AM
    Station   CNBC
    Location  Network
    Program   The Squawk Box


              Mark Haines, co-anchor:

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

                        # # #

Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.

Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.

That work?

Best,
Jeff

Nice job.  In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision? Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.  Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.  Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.

Best,
Jeff

Dorothy -- Attached is a another version of the letter that takes a little
different approach.  What do you think?  I worried that your first letter
looks a little like an invitation to pile on the exit fees, of all types and
in any magnitude.  I think we need to attack the premise that any DA causes
an increase in DWR costs for other customers.  Bill

Subject: Governor wants to cut costs of power
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
"Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
"This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." 
"Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."

Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.

Subject: Conversation with Fielder of Edison
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The call was pretty tough. 
Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  Thoughts on Recent Information
 Regarding our PX Credit Claim and Meeting with Edison Tomorrow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edison has dripped out information over the last 48 hours that reveals what the team had anticipated for some time:

Edison will pay ESPs what they are owed w.r.t. the negative CTC when they pay everyone else ("sometime in Q1'02").
However, Edison has told us and will tell ESPs today that they intend to very aggressively push the PUC to charge DA customers for "their fair share of the PX credit," since in their view DA customers (through the negative CTC) "contributed to the undercollection no more and no less than bundled customers did." 
They claim they are "on the side of the angels" because it is an "equity" issue, and that allowing DA not to pay would be a massive "jailbreak."
Their calculation is simple:  If DA represents 10% of the load, then DA is responsible for paying down 10% of the undercollection.
Edison wants the undercollection recovered over the period of its settlement (they claim that, based on their calculations, they can recover it over 2 years).
In short, Edison is zero-ing out payables tied to negative CTC by forcing ESPs/DA customers to pay it back through rates over the next two years.
In a conversation yesterday, Edison said that it is not attempting to link the two.  That is, they are not making payment of PX-credit-related debt on agreement by ESPs to pay a portion of Edison's undercollection through rates over the next two years.
Presumably, in this way, Edison can say, "We said that we would pay our creditors, and we did.  It was the PUC who sets the rates and decided to claw back by charging ESPs/DA customers as part of the normal course of fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities." 

Implications
Clearly negative from the perspective of expeditiously recognizing earnings for amounts Edison says it will pay us when it pays everyone else in Q1.
Equally important, it may increase significantly the risk of recognizing earnings for what PG&E will pay us.  If the PUC addresses whether ESPs/DA customers should contribute to pay down Edison's undercollection, it will likely also want to address the issue for PG&E.  We need to discuss the extent to which the PUC can meddle with PG&E in this regard given that PG&E is pursuing its work out through bankruptcy.

Impact on tomorrow's meeting:
I still think it is constructive to meet face-to-face with Edison tomorrow, but wanted to give folks the option of doing it by conference call:
We still have to determine whether we have agreement on what they owe us.  This includes calculations up to Jan. 17; the period from Jan. 17 to when we put our customers back on bundled service; and the period since they've been returned to DA status.
Since Edison claims they will pay everyone at the same time--sometime in Q1'02--there seems to be some value in determining what that number is, and getting the agreement in writing.
Second, it would be useful to explore with Edison why they have chosen to take an extreme, hardball stance on the issue (given that the PX Credit issues represents about $243MM/~$6B = 4-5% of the total debt).
In addition, it would be useful to let Edison know that they are in for a very long, protracted litigation struggle if, once they've paid us, they attempt to take it back through ratemaking shenanigans at the PUC.  
In yesterday's conversation with Fielder, I told him that Edison is ensuring World War 3 and that they'd better prepare for it if they intend to pursue this unreasonable approach. However, I tried to keep things as cordial as possible in an effort not to close down communications altogether.
Other ESPs and DA customers are likely to oppose Edison's proposal.  Sue's informing the ARM coalition of what Edison's up to.

Buckle up and hold tight.  Like I said before, you've got an immense amount of support and respect from your group, irrespective of the outcome.  Man, who ever woulda thunk...

FYI:  Calger came down from Portland to talk to the troops--he was pretty darn tough on his criticism of old management (the one's who have left) and said the new team is pushing hard to clean things up and right the ship---he did a pretty good job.  Guess the question remains, Is the mess too big to clean up?

Also, touch based with Jim when you get a minute re: meeting today with Edison to try to get our money back.  Edison is being an absolute *$#-hole.  Their bottom line, if you can believe it, is that WE OWE THEM money.  The arrogance is astounding. We're contemplating as an option recommending to you and management that we join with others and threaten to take Edison in involuntarily---just contemplating at this point, though. ??If you have any questions, just let me know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good draft.  Few comments:

*	As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the
action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them.  As
such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you
go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly
charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the
Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short,
I don't see an upside to it and there is downside.  Rather than try to
edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be
deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific
areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down
generally.
*	Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give
OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here):  e.g., The
Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what
the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold
hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything
else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues
raised by Karl.
*	On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming  what Angelides and
others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state?  Sure we need
to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already
knows of the bind they're in?  Could backfire.
*	Point # 6 on page 14:  are  we inviting the Commission to ask
parties to submit contracts?  Possible to re-write or eliminate this so
that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them?

Good job.  Thanks for your efforts.  Seems that the key thing is to let
the Commission know unequivocally that it must hold extensive hearings
on the many factual issues in dispute.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: RE: Call Regarding Prehearing Conference on Our Negative CTC
complaint


Hello all.  I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again.  As
for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX
credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the
"free-for-all" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the
issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post  Jan 17 time frame
and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs
to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the
original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period.  Therefore, they will say
that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve
all the issues in the complaint.  I should respond to SCE's attorney soon,
so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar.  Is
everyone in accord?  Mike Day

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that
we don't want this "payment of PX credit" issue in this proceeding --
the "free-for-all" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I
am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the
impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

Subject: FW: SCE-QF Update
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday, we discussed that Edison is likely going to try to jerk around ESPs, QFs and generators on past due amounts under its settlement with the PUC.  Here's the latest on what they're doing to the QFs.

Subject:	SCE-QF Update

I listed in on this afternoon's IEP call re: SCE's MOU.

According to Smutney-Jones (who was more than average mad), SCE has reneged on the "pay 10% up front" portion of the deal they struck with SCE.  According to IEP, SCE says that the banks, who are spooked by TURN's success in getting a 14-day temporary suspension of the CPUC-SCE settlement, is not interested in allowing SCE to pay any creditors like QFs preferentially. SCE said the 5.37 c/kWh commitment is still there, however.  IEP's was also unsuccessful in getting the effective date of 5.37 c/kWh changed in return for the loss of the 10% up front.

CCC/Jerry Bloom, who represents gas-fired QFs is seperately negotiating with SCE and may be willing to give up 10% in return for commiting to 5.37c/kwh outside of the CPUC.  (They are concerned with CPUC overturning the IEP-SCE "deal.")

Several parties on the call, including CalEnergy, indicated they may sue SCE outside the CPUC over reneging on this deal.

Subject: Edison and the PUC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff will be talking to Fielder on this.

SCE said at our meeting Monday that they DID NOT want to talk about these issues at the PHC -- they wanted to address it through the advice letters. This one shouldn't even be up an issue at all.

Hi Sue,

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 deadline.

Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20
contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before
September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which
you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D
01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails
supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is
in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on
rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

I received your attached customer list dated 11/1/01, however, per the
attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a
certified
customer list was 10/5/2001. SCE will use the list you submitted on

As a result of input from the Rule 22 Working Group meeting held
yesterday,
October 2, 2001 in San Francisco, Southern California Edison is
extending
the date by which ESPs should provide the customer list information as
requested in the original SCE communication below.    Please provide a
certified list of customer information not previously submitted to SCE,
as
set forth in the original e-mail below, no later than

     5:00 p.m.Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Friday, October 5,  2001

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com.

We have attached the template below to use for your convenience.


(See attached file: DA Cust List Template.xls)

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.



Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct
access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC
order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or
verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access
service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern
California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20,
2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject
to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your
DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or
verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit
the
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect"
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering
options) for existing Direct Access customers.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.

Responses to your questions:
 
I think Enron would like to exclude the PX Credit issue from this case.  I am comfortable taking the lead from Enron on this issue and would support not advocating it be included in this case.  I think SCE is going to push for its inclusion, so Sue will need to provide you with some amunition on why it doesn't belong in this case before Wednesday.
 
On the second question, no.  I don't think we want to re-raise the rev req and tres letter leading to the end of DA.
 
I not sure we should push the bottoms up issue in this case.  It is not at all clear what the ALJ is trying to pull into the case with the reference to post px credits.  There is no pending matters on this, but for advice letters and protests.  We are much better fighting in that forum given the current decisions rather than getting some nasty decision from Barnett that messes up the victory we got in the rate increase decisions.
 
I strongly urge that we NOT push this into this proceeding.  It will be all downside.  Changes to the PE Credit (i.e. reductions) may end up here, but we should not be calling for it.
 
Lastly, how can we say that the commission doesn't have authority to implement exit fees without changes in law given prior filings of ARM that said they should implement a whole host of exit fees rather than end DA.  I don't think we can take this position without explaining the flip flop, which we certainly don't have room to do in the PHC statement.  Maybe we can get away with referencing other parties strong position on this and support the requirement of hearings if any such attempt is going to be made to establish exit fees.
 
Thanks
 
Aaron

Subject: Prehearing Conference Statement - COMMENTS NEEDED
Importance: High


Attached for your review and comment is a very rough first draft of the prehearing conference statement that we must bring to the hearing on Wednesday afternoon.  It outlines, with some substance, the issues you have indicated we want to bring up, it identifies a few questions and seeks guidance from AReM members.
 
Please review and get back to me with comments by the close of the day, if possible.  I am running to the airport (which is why this is not in as finished a form as versions normally sent to you) and will be looking for comments in my hotel room this evening.  
 
Also, do we want to invite WPTF to join with us again, as it did in the comments last Friday on the Wood Ruling?
 
thanks!

Quick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.

Subject:	RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

Greetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that Karl Wood and Bob Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  Dorothy, talked to Keith yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.

Rick:

With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.

I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).

Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.  

I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.

Best,
Jeff

PS Given DYN and ENE share prices today, looks like the market loves the combination.  That's pretty nice.  (Wouldn't know it by what Rebecca Smith keeps writing, though.  Gives the impression that she won't be content until we're reduced to ashes--shame.)

THE MARKETS
Suitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St.
By ALEX BERENSON

11/13/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Wall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegy's $9 billion takeover of the Enron Corporation yesterday. 
Three days after Dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in Houston, agreed to take over Enron, its giant crosstown rival, Dynegy executives came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company's profits. They met a receptive audience.
Dynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. Since last Wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, Dynegy's stock has risen more than one-third. Enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent. 
After some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have accepted Dynegy's view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity. Enron's stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives. 
But Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday that Enron's problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. He largely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that Enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations. 
''There's nothing wrong with Enron's business,'' Mr. Watson said in an interview at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors. ''The people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money.'' 
Enron's immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it, Mr. Watson said. A $1.5 billion cash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enron's business partners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. To bolster Enron further, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an additional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. The potential investments by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. 
Mr. Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees who are angry that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as Enron's shares plunged. ''Right now, there's some animosity over there,'' he said. 
Many employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed, he said. The company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice. 
Mr. Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegy's earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share. 
Analysts backed that view yesterday. ''Investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital,'' said Thomas Hamlin, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Hamlin said he believed that Dynegy had obtained Enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue last year, for a bargain price. 
''It's not too often you get to take out the No. 7 Fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime,'' he said. ''My guess is the stock is worth $70 per share.'' 
The deal could increase Dynegy's earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group. 
''That's a whopper,'' he said. ''It's a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.'' 
Mr. Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself because of ''the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.'' 
''We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,'' he said. ''A good company was being badly tarnished.''

Hi Jeff - Here's the deal, I've had a cold for a few days. I'm probably past the contagious stage but this is not an exact science. I'm up for teaching today but I figure it's fair to let people know in case they're concerned. I'll see you at 4:30 unless I hear from you in which case I'll understand. Hey, thanks for facilitating this little DAW discussion group. I think I understand the procedure now. I had to hunt around a little for the "reply to all" command(not on my tool bar), but I found it. Now I'm ready. I'm still learning about a lot of this stuff. Later - Avram

Subject: Peaker Facility We Discussed Last Week
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dan:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.

The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.
The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.
For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.
By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.
In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.
We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.
Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.

Thanks for listening. Let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, 

Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today. I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.  I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.  Jim agreed.  Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach.

See attached.  Crazy Commissioner (Carl Wood) at the PUC is now trying to require folks to submit their DA contracts to the PUC (everyone refused the first time he "asked").  Customers are going to get very cranky about this.  Likely to be a pretty pitched battle.  I'm contacting the large customers to see what they intend to do.  Can't see them going down without a fight. We should plan on discussing with Mike Day first thing on Wednesday morning, if folks are available. Please forward to anyone else who needs it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're in the process of working with market participants (i.e., ESPs, large customer groups, etc.) to figure this out. There are many thorny legal issues that need to be worked out and many regulatory lawyers are combing over the implications, options, etc.  Our goal is to come up with a solution that:

1) meets the Commission's objectives of administering the DA suspension date of 9.20.01.
2) gives the Commission the information it needs to administer the suspension without requiring customers to submit specific contract language (which the Commission doesn't need to administer the suspension)
3) gives customers full flexibility to use contract provisions entered into with ESPs
4) fully protects confidential commercial information contained in the contracts

In general, there appears to be considerable reluctance on the part of the industry to submit contracts to the California Commission, which doesn't regulate either counterparty.

In short, the issues are tough and complex.  We're meeting first thing with groups next week, and presumably, we can get back to our customers soon thereafter with more info.

Mike Smith likely has additional insights from the legal perspective.

If there are any other questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:  FW: Assigned Commissioner's Ruling Requiring That Direct Access C
      ontr acts And Agreements Be submitted in A.98-07-003 et al.


Steve -- The attached ruling by Commissioner Wood -- just received late
today -- puts Jack in the Box at significant risk of being placed in a
category of "uncooperative" direct access customers whom the CPUC might
seek
to deprive of the entitlement to their direct access contracts -- unless
Jack provides a copy of its contract (initially under seal) for
consideration as evidence in the CPUC proceeding.  The "protection"
contemplated by the Assigned Commissioner is comparable to that accorded
utility documents submitted to the CPUC, which are protected unless and
until the Commission or a presiding Commissioner or ALJ decides public
disclosure is warranted.  An earlier ruling indicated a willingness to
allow
redaction of customer identifying information and that would be easier to
make effective if the contract were to be submitted by our ESP (is it
Enron?) rather than by us.  Maybe we should try to get the ALJ or the
Assigned Commissioner to agree that if an ESP submits a customer's contract
(with identifying information redacted) and includes the customer's name on
a list of all customers whose contracts have been submitted, then the
customer need not do so.

Is confidentiality important to Jack in the Box?  If so, what information
in
the contract would need to be redacted to provide adequate confidentiality
protection (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, etc.)?  Is Jack's ESP willing
to
cooperate in seeking a solution such as I've suggested above?

I'm leaving town Wednesday at noon and will be in hearing in LA Monday
through Thursday of next week.  But I'll be checking e-mail and voice mail
regularly.

Regards,

Marty

Dan: Looks good.  Sue calls me a party-pooper, but I've hi-lighted areas (in bold italics) that I think would benefit from some smoothing of the edges.  Not that I don't very much enjoy reading it.  I do.  I'm just concerned that it will unnecessarily create additional hostility in what is already--as you know--an incredibly hostile environment.  Thanks again.

Apologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion, but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with Bill and Aaron.  Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?

Best,
Jeff

All,

Unfortunately, Aaron and I will not be able to make this call.  However, we
wanted to let the group know that we are strongly opposed to New West's
proposal and urge the group to adopt the position we agreed to during last
week's call, i.e., oppose the UDCs' proposal for a DASR cut-off date, for
the reasons outlined in Dan's most recent draft.

Thanks.

I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.  
 <<arm-puc-plan.doc>> 
Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for review
and validation

Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?

Best,

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.
