Paul,
 
I noted my name on the list of interviewers below then in a later e-mail it was removed from the list.  Given the fact that you still need interviewers for first round and I had volunteered my availability to yourself and Jim Steffes, is there any reason why I would not be on this first round trip?
 
Thanks for letting me know so I can plan accordingly!

Straight to the Source

Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news. Importantly, the merger settlement provided $32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania.

This year, the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit, Power Team, presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania. These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement, and are not included in the $32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding.

Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East, the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms, two of which will be operational next month. The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week, and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week.

Mike Freeman, the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible, gave us some insight into Exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into America's power grids.
---------------------------------
What's in Power Team's renewable portfolio?
We have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage, 150 MW of wind, 100 MW of landfill methane, 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste, 20 MW of wood waste, and 16 MW of scrap tires.

All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as "new" resources. All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e, but only 10 MW is new generation. Of the hydro, all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards. The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e, but the biomass plant is.

Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio?
There were two principal reasons: a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace, and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel, emissions, and cost.

Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome?
I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business. I don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases. Part of the hands-off approach was due to, I believe, a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation, not changing the power system in any way.

Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system. For me that's the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development. I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable, and that demand for these products could be sustaining.

Will this encourage new development?
Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location, but is also willing to talk about additional new projects. Over time, other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same. If this chain of events occurs, I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter, just like other energy products now.

How do renewables fit into Power Team's overall business strategy?
We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio. So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy. More specifically, we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy, not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards, but also because of natural demand. The average person may not think of it this way, but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements.

Why Wind?
There's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements, under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects. A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998, and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year. A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years, and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand, including supply-side and demand-side solutions. We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources.

What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal?
The first is probably the need for a long-term contract. Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price, long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period. We don't have a problem with long-term deals per se, although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well. We don't want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else.

In my discussions with generators so far, there has been some flexibility on contract length. In fact, our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built. Beyond the long-term contract, the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating. Exelon Generation is rated A- by S&P so we are a natural counter-party for project financing. Right now, there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have.

Will that always will be the case?
No. If we're right about long-lasting demand, I think other large companies, including distribution companies, will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects. We've teamed up with a retail marketer, Community Energy, to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it. In the development of conventional generation, it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built. For example, a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods. And in some cases, the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing.

Is there a financial advantage for wind?
If one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value, a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have. Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility. This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present.

It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term. But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project, outside of significant advances in technology. Over a long period of time, 15 or 20 years, I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite.

I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years.

Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio?
With conventional generation and firm transmission paths, a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets, whether they are hourly, daily, monthly, or longer. Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing, amount and ultimate sink of expected output.

The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100% of the time as possible, so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy. The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different, because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy.

I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio. We're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix.

How does intermittent generation add complexity?
A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows, not when you flip the switch on. It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency, even for an experienced organization like ours, because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind. You don't have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand.

In PJM, where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis, and receive (or pay) market-clearing prices depending on actual generation, wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties. An obstacle, and we're working with PJM on this right now, is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity. For purposes of regulating the system, PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate, or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand.

This will not be practical with wind generation. We'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do. In the must-run scenario, we'd still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators. Either way, we'd have to predict output, which is a dicey
proposition.

Does that make wind generation unreliable?
Not at all. We've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time, such as a full year. Those predictions underlie our contracts. But it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow. The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what I've described. In PJM, a 54,000 MW system, this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now, but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives. A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system.

The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution.

How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind?
An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as "negative" load instead of generation. Which is to say, when the plant is generating electricity, the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating. When the plant is not generating, the load will increase. A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve. In this unique circumstance, which of the ancillary services apply to negative load, and at what level? We're working with PJM on these questions.

I'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider. Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load, and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way. Other countries, and the western U.S. transmission systems, have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation, and so can we.

Are you working on other approaches?
Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market, to a control area that does have such a market. The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis.  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment. However, notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach.

Will PJM resolve these problems?
Yes. PJM is progressive and innovative, and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling/imbalance issue. It's hard now because we're breaking new ground. I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed.

How big might your renewable portfolio get? Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects?
As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy, we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy. I'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market, such as PJM, to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output.

We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed. We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on. If we execute a contract successfully, we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company. Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. and National Wind Power.

What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster?
We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment, standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation, financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing, and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage.

Perhaps most importantly, we need consumers to buy the wind energy!

EPMI is the QSE.  As long as our customers don't mind that we are deciding their congestion charges internally, then this should work.  My concern was that our customers would balk at Enron deciding how much of our costs they should pay?

We should have no problem with the pass through of congestion in Texas.  The QSE receives a charge for our entire load and then allocates it to our load of a pro rata basis.  We then pass through these costs to the customer.  This is the same way we do things in the NE and the only way we can pass through intrazonal congestion.  If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call at 33143. Thanks.

Subject:	FERC Discussion on Standards of Conduct NOPR


My notes from the Standards of Conduct NOPR discussion:

Draft NOPR would:
adopt one set of standards to apply to gas and electric transmission owners;
broaden the definition to include all affiliates of transmission companies (including affiliates engaged in financial transactions)+
NOT apply to RTOs

The Commissioners were presented with 2 options:
Option A would maintain the status quo with respect to native load;
Option B would require separation of transmission function from bundled retail load.

It appears that there are 3 votes for Option B.   Breathitt was the hold out, expressing concern with respect to timing given that the FERC is trying to build a strong relationship with state commissions.    Pat said he was "surprised" to learn that bundled retail sales were excluded.  Massey sees this as an "opportunity for discrimination to end."   

NOTE:   Pat sent a message that, if he doesn't hear from "people" that this is the right way to go, he will back down.  He will be looking for factual evidence that on the costs and benefits associated with unbundling.   Massey asked staff if there are "operational reasons why this change shouldn't be made."  We may want to comment on this.

Subject: FW: Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Harry & Nancy --

I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.  In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the "customer of record" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.  

Let's talk.

In my opinion this is not beneficial to EES at all.  We have been following this issue through our Retail Market Subcommittee and all REPS are not happy with this process.  We are now required to calculate, collect and remit all taxes related to T&D charges.  We also take a hit on Gross receipts tax.  Jim, you should call and talk to Ron Adzgery.  Thanks.

Subject:	Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services

Jean/Jim:

Jeff Fischer and I in EES Tax have been working with Nancy Hetrick regarding the question of whether REPs will be responsible for administering Texas taxes on T&D services.

As you may have heard, at the request of a number of investor owned utilities, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts has initially ruled that REPs will be responsible for administering the taxes.  This conclusion was based upon the assumption that the REPs are purchasing the T&D Services from the TDU and then reselling the services to their customers.

After a number of REPs objected to that ruling, the Comptroller's office agreed to reconsider.  We believe the Comptroller is worried about doing something that will have a serious impact on deregulation in Texas, so she is passing the question off to the Texas PUC by requesting that the PUC determine whether REPs purchase and resell T&D Services.

The New Power Company raised this issue with the PUC recently and at last count TXU and Entergy had filed responses of their own.  A number of tax representatives from several REPs thought it might be good to show the PUC this is a significant issue for all independent REPs.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a proposed letter to the PUC regarding this matter.  Nancy suggested we send the letter to you for your comments and to get clearance for EESI to sign the letter.  Thank you for your assistance with this.

Ron

Charles --

After our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider --

1.	How does NERC define "security"? (important to differentiate between national security and system security).
2.	What is NERC's role in national security?
3.	Will RTOs degrade national security?  system security?
4.	What does Enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?
5.	Does Enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?

This Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.

Thanks.

1) Who is the intended audience of these points? NERC? or outside NERC about NERC?  The message has to be tailored to the audience.

There are people in various places DOE, NERC, NIPC, some utilities, that feel empowered by the events. We do not want to belittle their concerns, we want to expose them to ridicule when they do not use their brain,

NERC is still the only game in town, We need to guide them to be truly impartial in the electric utility restructuring, but also be ready to expose the abuse of their Information monopoly position.

Do we work from within? or launch our missiles to attack their standing?

What is the role of the MIC in regards to this issue within NERC?


2) Central Repository of Data. I wanted to discuss this point to determine if we should lobby to strengthen this system or let it die through neglect?. The key is that the institution that hold access to this information has power.

3) Actions with DOE. The one that was more concerning to me, is the perspective of some coordinators to "play it conservatively"; I interpret it as, refusing to schedule some market transactions.

4) RTOs. Tom Bowe of PJM blasted the NERC staff  at the meeting when he got hold of the Energy Daily article.

Subject:	RE: NERC and Terrorism

Charles,

Some comments.  I removed some words I though made NERC look too respectable/official, embellished some of your points, added a section on RTO security risk, and added some stronger "chastisement" words at the end.  They may be too strong, but I think the paper needs to be assertive.  Out of curiosity, is there an intended audience?  If it is NERC, maybe the more passive approach is preferable, but if it is anyone else, then maybe the aggressiveness would be a good thing. I think we want to make sure the audience finishes by looking at NERC and shaking their head in disgust, rather than sighing and shrugging their shoulders.  Of course, that could backfire and make us look like we're unfairly attacking NERC without any provocation, especially given the esoteric nature of some of our points.

Thoughts?

Looks good.  Why doesn't EPSA propose a timeline for the FERC to order?  This could be a signal that we only want one "rule change" date.  Also, maybe we can build in Kevin's argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now.

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

Subject:	RE: MG Load Curtailment Option

Jim: I have participated in a number of calls with Jeff and his team over the past few weeks regarding this deal, goving over the details of how NY's demand response programs work, reviewing draft contracts, and putting him in touch with appropriate ISO staff when even more detailed followup was needed. I see little likelihood of NY's demand response programs being eliminated over the next few years given the increasingly tight supply situation the state faces and the long lead time for permitting and bulding new generation, and the great success these programs achieved this past summer. (Most folks credit the 600 MW produced by NY's day-ahead and emergency demand response programs with keeping the lights on in the northeast during the early August heat wave.) Only the day-ahead incentive program has a risk of not being continued beyond October 2003, it's current expiration date. However, even there, there is likely to be pressure to extend it for an additional year or two. With respect to potential RTO impacts, in our discussions with PJM, they have stated that at a minimum they would allow NY to continue its demand response programs in the new Northeast market on day 1, even if they differed from the rest of the region.Further, PJM would even consider making the NY programs applicable throughout the region on day 1 if that was what the market participants in the region wanted to do.

Jim, Jane Tholt is the primary contact for Leslie and me on this filing.  Although I wouldn't have any problem changing the order of the arguments, Jane is pushing the pooling issue very hard and she wants to see it up front.  She has actually tried to make even more arguments on pooling, but Leslie and I have so far convinced her that doing so would not be helpful.  We went over the draft with Barry, Janie and Stephanie last Thursday, and he did not raise any concerns with the order of the arguments.  Leslie -- could you work in an "executive summary" up front with bullet points?
 
Pooling is actually a very important issue for the day to day business on El Paso, and this is our only opportunity to make these arguments.  It's a major concern because increasing the number of pools was a key component of El Paso's proposal that is the basis for this proceeding, and we don't think FERC staff fully appreciates the consequences of increasing the number of pools.  In addition, a few of the shippers, including SoCal Gas, have indicated that they would like to have a system with receipt point rights all the way back to the wellheads, which the West Desk is totally opposed to, and unfortunately, FERC Staff data request questions seemed to indicate they might be seriously considering it as an option. 
 
Thanks for your input.  So far, I haven't had any comments from anyone else.

Becky -- 

My only question is one of emphasis.  Are points 3&4 the key for Barry T.?  If so, should we move them up higher?  Also, why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points?  The length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate.  Maybe a list of bullet points up front?

Subject:        PLEASE RESPOND BY FRIDAY, 10/5 -- El Paso Comments RP00-336 

Please review the attached filing and provide any comments you may have by COB Friday, 10/5.  

The filing is ENA's comments on El Paso's proposal for receipt point allocation, focusing on discussions at the two technical conferences in the proceeding.  Also, it may be that, based on further discussion with certain other shippers, we will modify our statement in Item No. 1 to to support a different version of the method for allocating receipt point rights, but only if there is strong opposition to our method.  We don't want FERC to select the method that El Paso proposed originally.

I have been following Form EIA-417 - Emergency Incident and Distrubance Report
 
I am not familiar with the changes on these other forms. Should I follow up on these as well?  
 

Form EIA-411, "Coordinated Bulk Power Supply Program Report," 
Form EIA-412, "Annual Electric Industry Financial Report," 
Form EIA-423, "Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants," 
Form EIA-767, "Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report," 
Form EIA-826, "Monthly Electric Sales and Revenue Report with State Distributions," 
Form EIA-860, "Annual Electric Generator Report" (combined Forms EIA-860A and EIA-860B), 
Form EIA-861, "Annual Electric Power Industry Report," and, 
Form EIA-906, "Power Plant Report." 

Since I have no former experience with these reports, it would be a great help if those familiar with these reports take a look at at them first and porvide me any comments.

John --

On this bill, I would think that as far as our competitive businesses go, we should work through EPSA.  Better to have the industry speaking with one voice.  To that end, do we know where EPSA is on this - Reliant and Mirant will have a much larger impact.  Finally, we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators.

Subject:	Energy Infrastructure Security Legislation



Senator Schumer's office sent over a copy of the Chairman's Mark that will form the basis for a hearing tomorrow and a mark up Wednesday in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on energy infrastructure security legislation.  Pat is working with the pipeline group on how it affects them since it clearly applies to natural gas pipelines.

It would also clearly apply to PGE and to physical power plant assets we operate.  The main impact here would be in the area of criminal background checks, including fingerprinting, for employees in categories to be determined in DOE implementing regulations.  The background check data would be shared with law enforcement.  The legislative language says that the background check regulations will "enable entities" operating "critical energy infrastructure facilities" to have these background checks.  "Enable" is an odd choice of language because it could mean "authorize" only or it could mean "require."  We should assume that the background checks will be mandatory despite this odd language.

The definition of "critical energy infrastructure facilities" would NOT appear to pick up our trading and other energy services businesses beyond pipelines, power plants and PGE.  The definition is "a facility for the generation or transmission of electrical energy, or the production, refining, transportation, or storage of petroleum, natural gas, or petroleum product, the incapacity or destruction of which would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States."

If there is some reason why we would want other facilities included in the definition in order to obtain authorization for background checks, please let me know.  It should be pointed out that the current draft does not contain explicit legal immunity for employers who provide information about employees to authorities.

John

Donna/Sarah--I got together with Audrey Zibelman from Xcel on Friday afternoon to catch up and she wanted to talk about the petition that Xcel and the other midwest utilities had filed on transferring their assets into a for profit transco, Translink.  In my discussions with Audrey, she expressed a hope that Enron would be able to support the filing and that she'd like to open a dialogue on how to get our support.  I indicated that there were at least 2 issues that would be of concern for us---support for one RTO and support for one tariff within that RTO.  Although she was open and probably even supportive of one RTO in the midwest, there is a separate tariff for any delivery within the Translink system within her proposal.  SHe described that tariff as being different than the Detroit Edison case that you guys filed against.  I confirmed that the publics who are in the transco (NPPD, OPPD, Cornbelt) would not agree to be in the transco without the separate tariff.

I have sent via overnight a copy of materials on the transco to both of you.  I told her that Donna was that lead on the Midwest team, and that you'd be willing to talk/meet with her.  If practical, it would be good if you could call her in the next few days for a number of reasons---1.) I am sure that Xcel is planning a similiar transco for the west and if you can get a better sense of whether we are on any of the same pages, it would be good to have that input for our western discussion on Wednesday in Houston  2.) she is one of the panelists for RTO week, so you might be able to set up a time in D.C. that you could meet in person  3.) you might be able to get a sense of what she will be talking about at RTO week on her panel.

Thanks for the info.  Please stay closely linked with the RTO Week activities to try and read Wood's questions.

Also, John Meyer from Reliant is testifying.  What will be his position?  Should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way?

Subject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT


Here are a couple of clarifying points:
 

The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge.  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. 
When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit. 
It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion.

Thane --

Based on Wood's statements while at the PUCT, what issues will most likely drive his choice of a congestion management model?  My understanding is that Shumel Oren is on the panel at FERC, has he said anything recently that would argue that ERCOT may not be effective?  
 
Finally, what are the minor changes to the ERCOT protocols to overcome the current obstacles so that if adopted we could use across the country?

Pat Profeta of Northridge Assoc. (Entergy's congestion management consultants) told me this too and said that Michael Schnitzer of Northridge has been asked to be on the congestion management panel for RTO week.  Michael is a strong advocate of the "SPP cornerstones" that are largely the basis of the "LMP/financial congestion hedge" model (initial model!) advocated in the SE RTO mediation report.  They are going to contact Thane to get more information about ERCOT -- they recognize that ERCOT has some problems.

Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.

This is just a rumor we're hearing, but we heard that FERC wants someone who knows ERCOT congestion management on the congestion management panel for RTO Week  because FERC (presumably Pat Wood) wants to use the ERCOT congestion management system as the standard CMS throughout the country.  From what I know about ERCOT (which isn't much and I have a call in to Thane to get an update), this wouldn't be a good thing for us.  We'll keep you posted.

Since this will be a financial deal initially that could be physical in the future, I have only included the value of the day-ahead program in our model.  Thus if we elect to become the physical provider during the 36 months, we will have an incremental benefit.  However, if we never become the physical provider, I need to know that I will be paid in the Day Ahead program for reducing load.

Three key regulatory issues:

1.  NYISO has an Hour-Ahead market that load needs to be allowed to participate in.  This would  clearly increase the value of the MG deal and our NY products in general.
2.  The Day-Ahead Demand Response Program needs to remain in-tact.  This allows EES to realize the value of our call options, whether we are financial or physical.  
3.  The baseline calculation for load reduction does not work.  This summer, one of IBM's sites reduced load by 2 MW's, which is clear when reviewing this usage curves on the day of curtailment.  However, when comparing to their CBL (as currently defined) there was no reduction and therefore no payment for IBM or EES.  As we have discussed, NY should look at ISO-New England's baseline calculations.  This is a much better approach for Enron and our customers.

Thanks - Jeff

Jim: I have participated in a number of calls with Jeff and his team over the past few weeks regarding this deal, goving over the details of how NY's demand response programs work, reviewing draft contracts, and putting him in touch with appropriate ISO staff when even more detailed followup was needed. I see little likelihood of NY's demand response programs being eliminated over the next few years given the increasingly tight supply situation the state faces and the long lead time for permitting and bulding new generation, and the great success these programs achieved this past summer. (Most folks credit the 600 MW produced by NY's day-ahead and emergency demand response programs with keeping the lights on in the northeast during the early August heat wave.) Only the day-ahead incentive program has a risk of not being continued beyond October 2003, it's current expiration date. However, even there, there is likely to be pressure to extend it for an additional year or two. With respect to potential RTO impacts, in our discussions with PJM, they have stated that at a minimum they would allow NY to continue its demand response programs in the new Northeast market on day 1, even if they differed from the rest of the region.Further, PJM would even consider making the NY programs applicable throughout the region on day 1 if that was what the market participants in the region wanted to do.

Subject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT


The conventional wisdom around ERCOT is once direct assignment of the CSC congestion costs takes place, then flowing across the CSC does have a cost and those who schedule across will be more judicious.  The second assumption is that the stakeholders chose the wrong limiting element to be the monitored constraint.  90% of the congestion charges can be attributed to that wrong "element".  If direct assignmnet of the congestion and/or designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model.  John Meyer, Shmuel Oren and most parties would agree with that.  This year will be very telling.
 
It would be worthwhile the coordinate with John prior to RTO week.

Thanks for the info.  Please stay closely linked with the RTO Week activities to try and read Wood's questions.

Also, John Meyer from Reliant is testifying.  What will be his position?  Should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way?  Wasn't he the head of Congestion Management in ERCOT originally?  I think this is Wood trying to ask him how ERCOT works.  What will he say?

Subject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT


Here are a couple of clarifying points:
 

The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge.  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. 
When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit. 
It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion.

Thane --

Based on Wood's statements while at the PUCT, what issues will most likely drive his choice of a congestion management model?  My understanding is that Shumel Oren is on the panel at FERC, has he said anything recently that would argue that ERCOT may not be effective?  
 
Finally, what are the minor changes to the ERCOT protocols to overcome the current obstacles so that if adopted we could use across the country?

Pat Profeta of Northridge Assoc. (Entergy's congestion management consultants) told me this too and said that Michael Schnitzer of Northridge has been asked to be on the congestion management panel for RTO week.  Michael is a strong advocate of the "SPP cornerstones" that are largely the basis of the "LMP/financial congestion hedge" model (initial model!) advocated in the SE RTO mediation report.  They are going to contact Thane to get more information about ERCOT -- they recognize that ERCOT has some problems.

Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.

This is just a rumor we're hearing, but we heard that FERC wants someone who knows ERCOT congestion management on the congestion management panel for RTO Week  because FERC (presumably Pat Wood) wants to use the ERCOT congestion management system as the standard CMS throughout the country.  From what I know about ERCOT (which isn't much and I have a call in to Thane to get an update), this wouldn't be a good thing for us.  We'll keep you posted.

Jim -- Is this what you want for your executive update?




CURRENT FERC INITIATIVES:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:   The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and Steve Walton from Enron will make a presentation on transmission planning and expansion.  Comments will be submitted to FERC in mid-November regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  In addition, the Commission stated that RTOs would not be required to begin on the Order No. 2000 start date of December 15, 2001; however, all public utilities are now required to commit by December 15, 2001 to join a FERC-approved RTO or lose their market based rate authority.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.  Comments are due late November.

ICAP Inquiry:  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue.  Comments are due October 17.
California Audit and West wide Price Cap Mitigation:  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and will require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Enron filed comments on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.  Hearing will be held in mid-December.
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  We expect a Commission order shortly.  
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings by the end of October.  
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  Enron filed comments advocating a NE RTO based on the PJM congestion management system with a proposed start date of December 15, 2002 (PJM has proposed an implementation date of November 2003).  Commission action is expected on or before October 31.  
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission (advocating an independent transco structure for the RTO and an LMP/financial transmission rights congestion model).  Enron filed comments in support (and advocating a December 2002 start date).  Commission action is expected on or before October 31.  
West -wide RTO Proceedings:  The Commission stated that it wants the proposed Desert Star RTO and RTO West to "marry up" into one RTO.  It appears that the Commission will treat California separately.  The Desert Star RTO has collapsed and the transmission owners are now proposing a "transco" structure.  Commission action is expected later this year.
Interconnection proceeding:     The Commission is expected to address interconnection issues (with standardized procedures and agreements likely) at its meeting on October 11.  Enron has strongly advocated standardized procedures and will participate in the proceeding.
Market Based Rate Authorization:  The Commission is expected to address procedures for qualifying to sell power at market based rates, which may include an assessment of localized generation in a particular region ("supply margin assessment").   The Commission is also considering adding tariff language that could make market based rates subject to refund upon date of a complaint or finding by FERC of market abuse.

Jeane, I have evidence on some DA bills where SCE has assessed late fees on
disputed bills.  I haven't been able to do a thorough analysis, but knowing

I understood that, until the CPUC makes a decision, the UDC can not charge
late fees on disputed bills.  Correct?

I do have a concern from the standpoint that users are ultimately at the scheduling mercy of the operator.  The operator can cut our schedule.  Perhaps this is referencing something like reserves, where a user/load serving entity may have gone under the reserves and it gets some penalty?

Subject: CBO Report - Can We Persuade FERC to Back Off Refunds?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION."

In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS."

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis.  The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly undercuts the "political" arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers.

Subject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a "federal case" out of the CBO report.  In other words, we should be aware of Dave's comments and concerns, but I would not suggest we contact CBO or anything like that.  If others think some response is needed, this is the type of thing EPSA should do, if done at all.  We should refrain from carrying water for the generators.  The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen, largely because the CBO report says that what California did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by deregulation.  That "60,000 feet" view is worth a mint politically and while there are parts of the report that we differ with, I think its value far outweighs its blemishes.

John,

My take on the paper is that is wasn't particularly flattering to the generators/suppliers.  It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as far as "history of the formation" is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with.  

Off the top of my head, they use the term "idle".  In my mind as a utility person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term, they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance, I realize it's only a word, but it carries many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding supply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case showing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high prices, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have understood the full picture.  They also don't really touch on the lack of supply side response.  According to Greg Conlin, the President of the P{UC when AB1890 in CA was designed, was a key part to the equation, they spend little, if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed.  They also give insuffucient explaination of the "per-se" reasonablness clause....There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later time.

I left my notes on the document back in my office, I can give you a summary early next week if that's OK.  I am currently fact gathering about PJM and NYISO congestion models with Steve Walton for RTO West...

Thanks,

Dave

Like most sources of information in DC, folks on the Hill pick and choose those that support their pre-conceived policy notions.  Having said that, the CBO is a respected source of information.  I read the summary and have the full report in my "to read" stack.  The summary actually made the report sound largely favorable from our perspective.  It wouldn't hurt to have a little more detail on the problems with the report as you see them so we can decide whether we need to do anthing or just be ready should a CBO witness testify at a hearing.

How much weight and influence do papers published by the CBO have with policy makers there in DC?  I have some concerns about the general tone and some of the conclusions contained in the report.  If these papers draw little attention, then , no harm, no foul.  But if policy makers tend to draw from these papers, then perhaps we need to correct or address some of the issues raised in this report.

Subject:	Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis - by the CBO

Jim,

Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by the CBO entitled, "Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis".  In reviewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ignore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were supposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate terms, such as "Idle" when describing plants that were unavailable because of maintenance or repair.

My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some of the claims made in this paper?

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: CBO Report - Can We Persuade FERC to Back Off Refunds?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION."

In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS."

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis.  The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly undercuts the "political" arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers.

Subject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a "federal case" out of the CBO report.  In other words, we should be aware of Dave's comments and concerns, but I would not suggest we contact CBO or anything like that.  If others think some response is needed, this is the type of thing EPSA should do, if done at all.  We should refrain from carrying water for the generators.  The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen, largely because the CBO report says that what California did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by deregulation.  That "60,000 feet" view is worth a mint politically and while there are parts of the report that we differ with, I think its value far outweighs its blemishes.

John,

My take on the paper is that is wasn't particularly flattering to the generators/suppliers.  It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as far as "history of the formation" is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with.  

Off the top of my head, they use the term "idle".  In my mind as a utility person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term, they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance, I realize it's only a word, but it carries many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding supply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case showing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high prices, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have understood the full picture.  They also don't really touch on the lack of supply side response.  According to Greg Conlin, the President of the P{UC when AB1890 in CA was designed, was a key part to the equation, they spend little, if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed.  They also give insuffucient explaination of the "per-se" reasonablness clause....There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later time.

I left my notes on the document back in my office, I can give you a summary early next week if that's OK.  I am currently fact gathering about PJM and NYISO congestion models with Steve Walton for RTO West...

Thanks,

Dave

Like most sources of information in DC, folks on the Hill pick and choose those that support their pre-conceived policy notions.  Having said that, the CBO is a respected source of information.  I read the summary and have the full report in my "to read" stack.  The summary actually made the report sound largely favorable from our perspective.  It wouldn't hurt to have a little more detail on the problems with the report as you see them so we can decide whether we need to do anthing or just be ready should a CBO witness testify at a hearing.

My thoughts.
 
I would change the section "Reliability" to "Operations".  The Current framework is Non-standardized;  Poor Seams Interface
 
Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that "Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner."  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
 
Under Generation - I would change "optional" to Optimal.
 
I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.

David, some suggestions (I cannot write directly on your presentation for some reason, so please call me at 713-301-3421 if you have questions.)
 
Add "real time" price
Add costs and "risk premiums"
Add Generation "and Transmission"
Add lack of "valid" grid information
Change the benefits to "Better ability for customers to utilize numerous energy products, including forward hedging tools and demand side management."  [[Which Enron sells!]]
 
Change Market to "Wholesale Market"  open
 
Also, why do you say 99% open after RTOs?  Is this due to publics that don't participate?  If so, then maybe say "100% open to the extent that non-jurisdictional entities, such as federal power agencies and state power authorities, participate"  or name some examples, such as TVA and BPA.

Subject:	EES Market

I met with Jim Woods to discuss reviewing the states that are open and taking a targeted approach to most efficiently leverage our resources towards tearing down barriers in states where we have a significant market opportunity with a value proposition.

Steve, to your question the other day as to how much market opportunity there is, what I gleaned from the meeting is that there are a number of opportunities that could take us through 2002, but after that it starts to dwindle unless we can mine deeper in states where we have been active.  However, the other interesting point is that EES does not have resources to necessarily determine where the value proposition is and is looking to us to present to them what we think might be markets that will work for them.  Thus, there may very well be more opportunities than they are currently focused on.  As preliminary step, Steve Montovano and I had talked about getting a document together that gives the high level summary of each state as a starting point.  Lynette Barnes has worked on such a document and Kathleen Sullivan is going to work with her further and get a draft to Steve and I for review and distribution to EES.  Jim was very interested in seeing such a document.  Jim also noted that a state that has opportunities in the first year, may not in the second, but could reemerge in the third.

Jim, Jim Wood also mentioned that he had talked to you about a more coordinated approach to EES and government affairs working together.  Jim and I are going to exchange lists of who is assigned to which states and then put together teams.  Steve Montovano and I will work on identifying the government affairs people for each state in our regions to give to Jim Woods.

It was agreed that over the next few weeks, I will put together a document that will try to preliminarily identify the states and more specifically the utilities where there may be opportunities for EES based on a number of issues.  The plan is to then share that with Jim Wood and then have a higher level meeting within EES to target where government affairs puts in its greatest efforts.  Once I have a draft, I will share it internally for comment before sending it on to Jim Woods.

Areas of interest to Jim were all of New England, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.  Illinois is emerging as one of their best markets and they are also interested in looking real hard at Michigan.  

With respect to Michigan, I met with the Michigan EES team and it appears that from a product development standpoint, they will be ready to go at the beginning of 2002, but the commodity desk is saying 2004 due to uncertainty on the RTO front, although they conceded that if progress is made, we could move the date up.  There was also a discussion of doing financial deals in Michigan for the first years until we are comfortable going physical.

I will keep you posted as this progresses, but I am optimistic that this cooperative effort will lead to greater opportunities for EES.

Janine

Subject:	RE: Bingaman reliability draft language


It is important to point out that under the Bingaman reliability language, FERC has total discretion as to whether to adopt a NERC standard.  Charles does make a good point about the deference language.  As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance.  At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB.  Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.

Subject:	RE: Bingaman reliability draft language

I understand that the NERC needs to be recognized for political reasons - but this shuts out the possibility of a EISB.  Since it recognizes RTOs, it should alos leave open the possibility of yet another entity to perform the reliability standards setting function,  at least allow for the RTOs to work through a central standards setting organization other than NERC.

Enclosed is my draft of possible revisions to the above-referenced reliability provision, taking into
account suggestions by Craig. I have enclosed a redline version and a clean one. The revision does
the following:
1.By adding"without hindering reliable, non-discriminatory, and efficiently priced transmission service"
it uses words of art from FERC Order No. 2000 and shows the intertwined nature of security and commercial practices.
2.By adding the reference to section 201(f), it specifically includes  Federal and State entities.
3.There is no named reference for any particular industry  standards body---thus no attempt to either
provide an advantage or disadvantage to any existing body.
4.The FERC could take into consideration recommendations of enties with technical expertise regarding reliability standards---such as WECC , Regional Advisory Bodies, and the States.
5. FERC could assign enforcement responsibility in a given area to any appropriate entity---such as WECC or RTOs.
6.It puts in a definition of reliability standards that is limited to security and, by not including adequacy, is
not as intrusive on prerogatives of States.
7.I bracketed the possibility of a States savings provision for further consideration. Of course, the
narrower the scope---i.e. no consideration of generation adequacy---the less need there is for such
a provision.
Please give me any feedback.

Subject:	Network Plus Service

Jim and Christi:

Here is language I proposed to EPSA to be included in "Standardized Tariffs:"

FERC must eliminate the distinction between network and point to point transmission service and create a new "Network Plus" service that is the only firm transmission service offered and is available to all transmission customers.

Julie questions if this is what we really want (we being all of EPSA, including the generators).  Julie is nervous about proposing to eliminate point to point service all together.  She thinks the problem with network is that utilities are preventing generators from getting the service.  I told her that is not our issue, and just changing the rules so that network service is available to generators does not help us.  

Julie suggested language that said something like "FERC should explore new transmission services for customers."  I told her that doesn't work -- we need to address this issue head on.  She is concerned that we're going to have dissention within the membership.

How would you all feel about retaining point to point service but making network available to everyone, with a much less restrictive sign up period (e.g. 1 month term rather than 1 year term), etc.  I think its cleaner to eliminate the two types of services and create a new "Network Plus" service that's available to everyone -- that would be the "firm" service and "nonfirm" would continue to exist.  Do you all think we would want to retain point to point service?  Even if we don't, if some EPSA members want to retain point to point service, we may need to think of ways to make network more user-friendly without eliminating point to point.

Let me know what you think

Thanks Jim.  I will push EPSA as much as I can.  I too don't see how this helps us.  I'm a little annoyed because I think Julie's focus has been primarily on getting better access for generators, and I know she heard the annoyance in my voice when I told her that better generator access is useless for us.  We've been pushing this issue for some time, and we have a lot of marketers in the group, so hopefully we will come to some sort of position that gets us all what we need.

Subject:	Network Plus Service

Jim and Christi:

Here is language I proposed to EPSA to be included in "Standardized Tariffs:"

FERC must eliminate the distinction between network and point to point transmission service and create a new "Network Plus" service that is the only firm transmission service offered and is available to all transmission customers.

Julie questions if this is what we really want (we being all of EPSA, including the generators).  Julie is nervous about proposing to eliminate point to point service all together.  She thinks the problem with network is that utilities are preventing generators from getting the service.  I told her that is not our issue, and just changing the rules so that network service is available to generators does not help us.  

Julie suggested language that said something like "FERC should explore new transmission services for customers."  I told her that doesn't work -- we need to address this issue head on.  She is concerned that we're going to have dissention within the membership.

How would you all feel about retaining point to point service but making network available to everyone, with a much less restrictive sign up period (e.g. 1 month term rather than 1 year term), etc.  I think its cleaner to eliminate the two types of services and create a new "Network Plus" service that's available to everyone -- that would be the "firm" service and "nonfirm" would continue to exist.  Do you all think we would want to retain point to point service?  Even if we don't, if some EPSA members want to retain point to point service, we may need to think of ways to make network more user-friendly without eliminating point to point.

Let me know what you think

Sarah

The $45 Million Rip Off

Running back Ricky Walters, a native of Harrisburg, once responded to a question about why he did not lay his body on the line to catch a ball over the middle by saying, "For who? For what?" Residential and business customers in the Duquesne Light service territory should also cry, "For who? For what?" to the news that, starting in January 2002 when Duquesne Light joins PJM West, they will be charged $45 million per year to meet PJM West's new capacity requirement called ACAP, the close relative of the rogue PJM ICAP rule.

Actually, in this instance, "for who" is clear. PJM and Orion are the parties for whom customers will pony up $45 million, or $32.40 per year for a 600 kWh monthly customer. Orion is charging $44 per MW-day for capacity, the equivalent of 0.45 cents per kWh. The cash goes into Orion's pocket and is a windfall for a "product" that typically has a marginal cost of zero (see the affidavit of Professor Peter Cramton, filed with FERC on behalf of the New England Independent System Operator, who properly concluded that ICAP should be scrapped). But the windfall to Orion is delivered courtesy of the PJM Independent System Operator that stubbornly clings to its failed ICAP market and won't  replace it with forward operating reserve markets and requirements.

The real mystery is, "for what" will customers be paying $45 million? Has anyone shown that Duquesne's reliability record has been unsatisfactory? Has PJM demonstrated that the $45 million would reduce Duquesne's loss of load probability? There are no good answers to those questions. ICAP/ACAP remain the biggest consumer rip-off in the wholesale market. It's past time for FERC, public utility commissions, and especially the offices of consumer advocate to insist on their abolition and replacement.

A few things must be remembered about ICAP:

Along with the huge ECAR region, an area twice the size of PJM, the Duquesne Light Control Area prior to January 2002 had no ACAP or ICAP rules. And yet for the last 30 years the lights have stayed on in Pittsburgh as well as or better than in PJM. Even when PJM had rolling blackouts on January 19, 1994, the Duquesne control area continued to provide reliable power.

So what will the $45 million buy consumers? More reliability? No. ACAP won't increase the Duquesne control area's historic level of reliability. And even if it would, why is it necessary? Reliability in the Duquesne control area has been excellent. In fact, Duquesne and the rest of the ECAR area ensure reliability through different, equally effective but lower-cost reliability rules.

The Current ECAR Model
The ECAR model could be summarized by the phrase "pay only for what you need." The current reliability mechanism is met through purchasing 4 percent operating reserves. These are made up of Load and Frequency Regulating (Spinning) Reserves (1 percent) and Contingency Reserves of 3 percent divided into 1.5 percent of contingency Spinning Reserves and 1.5 percent of Contingency Supplemental Reserves. These reserves margins have served western Pennsylvanians well, resulting in reliable service equal to - and in some cases exceeding - PJM.

Reserve payments compensate only those units that are not operating at the time but have the capability of generating in less than 10 minutes. The cost for these reserves is not easily calculated due to lack of a transparent market. Yet they appear to be approximately less than $2/MW-day during on-peak periods and often less than $1/MW-day. This would result in costs of less than $1.15/MW-day based on the Allegheny Power peak load. The cost for a typical residential customer would be .012 cents per kWh.

The Current PJM Model
The PJM model could similarly be described as, "pay for everything and still pay extra for what you need." Generators receive three payments, the reserve payments mentioned above, a capacity payment, and an energy payment. PJM, like ECAR, has a need for operating reserves and purchases these in order to maintain reliability. Additionally, the PJM model provides an Unforced Capacity payment to all generators based on their historical performance. Generators receive this payment whether or not they are able to operate on a particular day or are already being compensated for providing electricity. PJM currently compensates generators based on a 19 percent reserve margin. The overall cost of ICAP has varied considerably over the three years of competition. The average since 1999 has been $78.74/MW-day. This results in overall costs of over $1.6 billion per year. Residential customers have experienced ICAP costs ranging from about 0.4 to 1.8 cents per kWh. Moreover, on top of ICAP, a PJM customer must purchase additional spinning reserves costing approximately the same as the reserves in ECAR.

Ending the Rip-off
PJM should move to a reserve-based reliability methodology similar to ECAR. An Operating Reserve-based methodology used in tandem with PJM's competitive electricity market will furnish the same level of reliability but at greatly reduced prices. This methodology should pay for those products that are really needed - excess reserves to be used during peak demand periods. A strong forward energy and operating reserve market can send the right price signals to build new generation - a fact that is readily apparent as we look to the Mid-west where thousands of megawatts of new generation have been built in response to clear price signals over the past few years.

All this tells us that ICAP has its self-interested defenders but no justification for raiding consumers' wallets.

Subject:	Re: Stakeholder Committee Notes

To add to Charles memo..

1) The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders committee. That was very positive.

2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues. 

3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to make the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example EISB

4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:

1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees representation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached "Initial Sectors and Criteria Model." This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for representation by "sector," and incorporates the Task Force's general recognition that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that some work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and the criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assuming that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Model, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends that two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existing standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role for ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemented.

2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open participation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. The Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedures used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features of those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures. Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within each sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.

3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be presented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concerns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.

4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for developing Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinvent itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in that direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings.

5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to decouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Funding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, should be pursued.

6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immediate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Process, and to provide a "bridge" until the new Organization Standards process is implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operating Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, including consideration of any minority positions.

5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a possible alternative.

6) Silence on the issue of "self regulating organization" . No one advocating that position.

7) Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner.

Subject:	Stakeholder Committee Notes

Here are some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vancouver this Monday.

The customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting.  Reps from Enron, Mirant, Dynegy, DENA, APPA and ELCON were present.

All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side.  This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Customers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting organization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task Force recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.

Agenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues
To ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in front of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are needed to get individual entities "on board" however, such details should not impede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.e.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to keep details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.

The actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the need for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns of the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most vocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (Glenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also supportive).  

Agenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators
Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC does not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo from Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolution.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new competitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC should not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly and specifically with the problem. 

A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions:
1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it.
2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take specific actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)

The vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not intended to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the industry is over this issue.

The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting reconvened.
The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:

?	Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of wholesale electric industry standards.  
?	Add words that "we need to go forward from where we are.
?	Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in new Board agenda item 22.
?	Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian and US government entities.
?	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such capabilities.
?	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operation issues as they affect wholesale operations.

Agenda Item 9 -Transmission Expansion
Reference to "incentive rates", and "accelerated amortization", should be removed, not a reliability policy need. 
The reference to these expansion solutions are intended to be tutorial and does not assume NERC will begin to undertake rate issues.  APPA - public perception will be different.  Must remove this language.  Glen Ross will present this report to the Independents outlining the strong opinions on both sides.

FYI - It looks like this is something that EES for sure and maybe ENA will have to comply with.  It is an EIA report required for all natural gas marketers with residential and/or commercial customers in the states of GA, MD, NY, OH, and PA; neither Leslie nor I received any notice of the potential requirement.  The OMB notice was published in the Federal Register in March, but since we don't typically monitor that publication, we did not see it, and I couldn't find any press reports on it.  Based on this correspondence, the first we heard about it was when EES got a copy of the form last week.
 
So that you don't have to plow through the attachment, here are the data elements that are to be reported for sales in each of the above states:
 
4. To how many end-use customers did you sell natural gas? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
5. How much natural gas did you sell to these customers? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
6. What was the revenue received for the natural gas commodity you sold to these
customers? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
7. Were there any receipts for distribution charges or taxes associated with the sale
of natural gas? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
_ Yes - Continue to Question #8

8. How much were these receipts? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
9. Please use this space for any explanation that may be essential in understanding your reported data.
10. Enter the name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the person to contact concerning the information on this report.
 
At this point, we don't think there is anything we can do about this procedurally .  Any other ideas?  I will find out from Donna Greif how much of a problem, if any, they will have compiling the information.

I found the attached information on the EIA website.  (I copied the screens and pasted them to the word document, so the format is a little off.)  Note that the report is required for all natural gas marketers with residential and/or commercial customers in the states of GA, MD, NY, OH, and PA.  It appears that EIA received OMB approval for the reporting requirement in late May of this year for a three-year period.  The actual form is available on EIA's website, as explained in paragraph 5, but the data elements are shown on page 4 of the attachment.  Note also the last two pages of the document, where EIA plans for further reporting are discussed.

The referenced form is a new form o be completed for the month of August, 2001.  It was due on 9/30/01, and I received it this week.
Donna - Is this the form that you were working on that we did the special request from CSC, ie, the FERC filing?  Thought maybe it was the same thing since it is new, effective 8/01 as you said the FERC request was.  Please let me know.

Ray --

Looks very good.  We need to stress the points on what we need FERC to do -- fix their mistakes in the Rehearing.  One other point, maybe we should stress that FERC could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the Cal ISO is taking so long.  Also, don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the "abuses" of the Cal ISO and its lack of independence.

The "message" is that the scope of the California "refund hearing" should be expanded to address the question of whether refunds are appropriate in the first place, and that the parties to the California hearing should be granted the same due process opportunities which were afforded the parties in the Pacific Northwest hearing.  Please let me have your comments and recommendations.  Ray

This is a direct result of the recent actions from GISB to get involved in the wholesale electric standards.   We and EPSA have made positive statements about the GISB process.  NERC has been forced to change to accomodate what many in the industry are looking for.  There are still many "ifs" at GISB at this time, much of it around how much the big utilitites would be willing to support it.  Our position has been - whoever provided the best deal first, that is where the industry will take its business.

Kevin's preferences for RTO standards is not out of the question.   FERC will utlimately decide how much standards setting authority the RTOs will have.   NERC will certainly foucs - at least - on inter-RTO standards, something RTOs will not do well, if at all.  Howvever, NERC must not impede on internal RTO market structures and rules - a "commercial standard"  - this is why NERC recognizing commercial interests is such a big step.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

RE: Docket EL01-68-000  Investigation of Wholesale Rates of Public Utility Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Services in the Western Systems Coordinating Council.
 
Dear Mr. Boergers: 
 
Enron Power Marketing Inc. (EPMI) respectfully requests the opportunity to make a statement during the October 29, 2001 technical conference in the above-referenced proceeding.  EPMI would appreciate the opportunity to allow the following representative to make a statement on its behalf:

G. Alan Comnes, 
Director, Government Affairs 
Enron Corp. 
121 SW Salmon Street 
Portland, OR 97204 
email: AComnes@enron.com 
telephone: 503-464-8129 

EPMI operates as a marketer of electric power and natural gas in markets throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC).  EPMI has been an active participant in this and related dockets and has submitted written comments pertaining to Westwide price mitigation on both May 7, 2001and August 20, 2001. In addition to identifying problems created by continued price mitigation in the WSCC, EPMI will identify problems that will be created if the Commission were to inconsistently apply price mitigation in the WSCC or make rule changes that create further uncertainty in the marketplace.   Because of EPMI's unique position as a power marketer that operates throughout the WSCC, it has a unique perspective to provide the Commission and workshop participants.

A letter making the same request, along with Mr. Comnes' credentials, will be filed with the Commission tomorrow.  If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact me at 713-853-3180.  

Sincerely, 

Robert J. Frank

Subject:	Conference Call Today with FERC Staff

A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

Charles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, 

I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the "new sector weighted voting model" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?

Andy



Gordon,

When did the ESC vote to adopt the  "new sector weighted voting model?"  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?

Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  

Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just "annex" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  

Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern?

SCHEDULE 4
	Energy Imbalance Service

Energy Imbalance Service is provided when a difference occurs between the scheduled and the actual delivery of energy to a load located within a Control Area over a single hour.  The Transmission Provider must offer this service when the transmission service is used to serve load within its Control Area.  The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements to satisfy its Energy Imbalance Service obligation. 	

The charges for Energy Imbalance Service, for which there is no deadband or return of energy in kind, are as follows:

C	Schedules insufficient to meet load ?? For each hour in which the Transmission Customer schedules insufficient energy to meet its load in that hour, the Transmission Provider will charge the Transmission Customer the Incremen? tal Cost (as defined below) that the Transmis? sion Provider incurs to meet the load of the Transmission Customer in that hour.

C	Schedules in excess of load ?? For each hour in which the Transmission Customer schedules en? ergy in excess of its load for that hour, the Transmission Provider will reimburse the Trans? mission Customer the Decremental Cost (as de? fined below) that the Transmission Provider incurs to meet the load of the Transmission Customer in that hour. 

 
Incremental Cost to provide energy imbalance service shall be defined as the Transmission Provider's System Lambda (the out?of?pocket costs, measured in dollars per megawatt?hour, associated with producing the last MWH of energy on the Transmission Provider's system in a given hour, whether that energy is produced by owned generation or the purchase of power from a third party) to compen? 
 
sate for the under?delivery of electricity by the Trans? mission Customer for that hour.  

Decremental Cost to provide energy imbalance service shall be defined as the Transmission Provider's System Lambda (the out?of?pocket costs, measured in dollars per megawatt?hour, associated with producing the last MWH of energy on the Transmission Provider's system in a given hour, whether that energy is produced by owned generation or the purchase of power from a third party) to compen? sate for the over?delivery of electricity by the Trans? mission Customer for that hour.

Christi;  The proposed settlement procedure does not seem to be that clear... usually LDC's allow participants either a percentage of pre-schedule or set MW volumes deviation which is cleared at the appropriate Index (Mid-C, COB etc.) and then any MW volumes outside the predetermined bandwidth would be settled at a percentage of the selected Index.  Montana Power Company (MPC) has an excellent working example.  John

EES and EPMI services folk -- We would like your comments on this imbalance proposal by Portland General (FYI--to the extent that FERC accepts Portland's proposal, it could be used as precedent for other utilities): 

PGE proposed a price to clear imbalances that was rejected by the FERC.  FERC told PGE to look to the Exelon order for guidance.  After an extension, the compliance filing is due Monday.  They have sought your reaction/comments.
 
 
 They had a discussion with FERC staff on how to comply.  
 
1.  Staff agreed that, under the Order, PGE could use the average spot price (excluding long term purchases) of purchases and sales in the hour before to clear imbalances (Schedule 4).
 
2. The PGE situation does not fit the Exelon model, because PGE does not have purchases and sales in every hour (apparently Exelon did).  FERC staff agreed the situation was different, but had no suggested solutions.  Staff requested that PGE propose "something" and the FERC would react.
 
3.  The something is -- A variant of the proposal recently approved for Pacific Corp (?):
 
PGE would use Mid C prices, but use PGE's actual daily load shape. [Apparently, Pacific Corp. proposed Mid C prices, but would use the load shape from California.  This load shape is quite different then PGE's and could lead to arbitrage opportunities against PGE by third-parties.]
 
4.  Right now PGE's traders and outside counsel disagree on the best approach.  The traders want to just propose/use the Mid C price proposal for all hours.  Outside counsel believes they should propose/use the average spot price proposal when PGE does make purchases and/or sales in the hour before and the Mid C proposal in other hours.
 
Do you have a preference?

Dave, per your request: 

Here are some bullets briefly describing the FERC audit high points.  I think the scope is "right on the money" and the timing is reasonably good also.  The text of the audit solicitation follows the bullets.  I've made contact with Andy Sakallaris, head of FERC procurement, to attend the pre-bid conference next Tuesday (assuming it is held, since expressions of interest thus far have been from CA based firms unwilling to make the trip to DC).  Ray

Audit description-  FERC seeks to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements in California markets; accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO will be performed to determine any areas in which the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibilities in operating the transmission system under its control and administering real-time energy markets.

Scope- Provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its FERC tariff and determine whether the CAISO's operations are adequately transparent to market participants.

Audit period- 10/1/00-10/1/01

Deliverables timing- Draft report due on January 9, 2002; final report due January 16, 2002.

Audit schedule-  Begins on November 1, 2001, and ends no later than January 4, 2002.

Pre-proposal conference- A conference is scheduled for prospective offerors at FERC next Tuesday; FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements and clarify any questions asked.

DESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial
  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6,
  as supplemented with additional information included in this
  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;
  proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will
  not be issued. FERC02RMT22071 is issued as a request for proposal
  and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC
  97-27. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number
  561. Statement of Work: I. BACKGROUND. The California electricity
  market has experienced great stress from Summer 2000 to Summer
  2001, with demand outstripping supply, wholesale prices rising
  dramatically, and key market participants becoming financially
  unstable. As a result, the California Independent System Operator,
  Inc. (CAISO), which operates the electricity transmission grid
  throughout most of California, was forced to adapt to rapidly
  changing circumstances. During all of this, the CAISO worked
  hard to ensure system reliability. Under the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission's market mitigation plan, wholesale prices
  stabilized in California in Summer 2001. The Commission seeks
  to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements
  in California markets, including improvements to help the CAISO
  in effectively performing its increasing responsibilities.
  Accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO
  will be performed to determine the areas, if any, in which
  the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its
  responsibilities in operating the transmission system under
  its control and administering certain real-time energy markets.
  II. SCOPE OF WORK. The Independent Public Accounting (Contractor)
  firm shall perform an operational audit of the CAISO processes,
  practices, and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted
  Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The Contractor shall
  provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its
  Commission tariff (procedures and tariff can be found at www.caiso.com).
  The Contractor shall ascertain whether the CAISO's operations
  are adequately transparent to market participants. To the extent
  possible, the Contractor shall also ascertain whether the CAISO's
  procedures and operations are consistent with the most effective
  business practice. III. AUDIT PERIOD. The audit of the CAISO
  shall cover the period commencing October 1, 2000, through
  October 1, 2001. IV. DELIVERABLES. The contractor must provide
  the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a draft
  and final report detailing the findings, operating deficiencies
  and/or major observations and recommendations. These reports
  and other deliverables must be provided to the COR by the close
  of business on the following dates: 1) Draft Report - January
  9, 2002 2) Final Report - January 16, 2002. V. SCHEDULE. The
  operational audit will commence on November 1, 2001, and it
  must be completed no later than January 4, 2002. The contractor
  shall meet with the COR to discuss the audit no later than
  November 6, 2001. The contractor must provide the Commission
  with an operational audit plan no later than November 14, 2001.
  A detailed operational audit plan will be submitted to the
  COR for review, feedback, and approval. The COR or designated
  representative will review the plan. VI. Working Papers. The
  contractor shall prepare and provide a copy of work papers
  in accordance with GAGAS. All work papers shall include the
  purpose, sources of information, the procedures performed,
  results thereof, and conclusions as appropriate for the planning,
  internal control, compliance, and substantive testing phases.
  For all findings, work papers shall clearly show the condition
  or problem, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation for
  improvement. All working papers shall be cross-referenced to
  audit programs, summaries, and final audit report. These documents
  will become the property of the Commission. During the course
  of the audit or upon completion of the audit work, the Contractor's
  audit report and work papers shall be subject to access and
  review by the Commission. A preproposal conference is scheduled
  for prospective offerors at FERC on Tuesday, October 16, 2001,
  at 10:00 am at 888 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426,
  Room 3M-3. FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements

ComEd wants to limit power purchase option
By Melita Marie Garza
Tribune staff reporter

October 17, 2001

Commonwealth Edison Co. on Tuesday proposed weaning its largest commercial
and industrial customers from a power purchase plan that the company asserts
stifles competition in the state's emerging market for electricity.

Under the proposal, the utility would differentiate between industrial
customers that use less than 400 kilowatts of electricity at any given
moment and those that use more, Pamela Strobel, ComEd's chairman, told the
Illinois Commerce Commission. A standard Jewel or Dominick's grocery store
uses about 400 kilowatts of electricity at a given moment, Strobel said.

Under deregulation, corporate customers have three options: Stay with
ComEd's standard regulated electricity service based on rates set in 1996,
pick an alternative supplier or opt for ComEd's so-called Power Purchase
Option.

Customers who pick the last option get ComEd's market rate but are allowed
to choose ComEd competitors as their primary power suppliers.

ComEd's proposal would bar its largest customers from that option, which the
utility says has stymied deregulation because it allows competing suppliers
to merely resell the power that ComEd produced.

"So long as the utility is providing this option, real competitive markets
won't work," said Arlene Juracek, ComEd's vice president for regulatory and
strategic services. "Some suppliers have taken the easy way out by telling
their customers to sign up for the plan."

Terry Harvill, an ICC member, agreed. "There was an unintended problem ...
rather than alternative suppliers coming into Illinois with diverse sources
of energy, essentially you have them just taking power from ComEd and
reselling it to customers," Harvill said.

Specifically, ComEd proposes to limit the Power Purchase Option to
non-residential customers paying competitive transition charges, effective
June 2002. The transition charges cover costs incurred by the utility prior
to deregulation.

"I think it's a step in the right direction, but the details remain to be
worked out," Harvill said. He noted that companies still would have the
option to fall back on ComEd's traditional regulated plan.

But Marty Cohen, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, was
skeptical.

"There are certain inherent conflicts in the way that Edison sees the world
because they are a subsidiary of a much larger company--Exelon--which is, in
fact, the largest producer and seller of electricity in this market," Cohen
said.

"So you have ComEd on the one hand being the largest buyer of electricity,
and you have Exelon, its parent company, being the largest seller of
electricity. This proposal doesn't address that issue."

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Subject:	RE: ComEd wants to limit power purchase option

First, I think the gig may soon be over since at least one commissioner is catching on to our chirade.  Second, since that's not a particularly helpful observation, I think we ought to be very blunt that the reason we had to play the chirade is that the PPO price is far and away better than anything we can match and that it is a subsidized price because it does not explicitly recognize ancillary service, imbalance, and retailer costs except for the pittances we got added in the case a year ago.  
So we can ask that the same subsidies be maintained for customers wo have chosen thusfar (grandfathered, in other words).  Going forward, it seems that elimination of the PPO would be helpful to market development so it's hard to argue against that.  So maybe we offer a trade - support for elimination of PPO in exchange for grandfathered treatment of existing contracts we have on PPO.

ComEd's standard regulated electricity service based on rates set in 1996,
pick an alternative supplier or opt for ComEd's so-called Power Purchase
Option.

Customers who pick the last option get ComEd's market rate but are allowed
to choose ComEd competitors as their primary power suppliers.

ComEd's proposal would bar its largest customers from that option, which the
utility says has stymied deregulation because it allows competing suppliers
to merely resell the power that ComEd produced.

"So long as the utility is providing this option, real competitive markets
won't work," said Arlene Juracek, ComEd's vice president for regulatory and
strategic services. "Some suppliers have taken the easy way out by telling
their customers to sign up for the plan."

Terry Harvill, an ICC member, agreed. "There was an unintended problem ...
rather than alternative suppliers coming into Illinois with diverse sources
of energy, essentially you have them just taking power from ComEd and
reselling it to customers," Harvill said.

Specifically, ComEd proposes to limit the Power Purchase Option to
non-residential customers paying competitive transition charges, effective
June 2002. The transition charges cover costs incurred by the utility prior
to deregulation.

"I think it's a step in the right direction, but the details remain to be
worked out," Harvill said. He noted that companies still would have the
option to fall back on ComEd's traditional regulated plan.

But Marty Cohen, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, was
skeptical.

"There are certain inherent conflicts in the way that Edison sees the world
because they are a subsidiary of a much larger company--Exelon--which is, in
fact, the largest producer and seller of electricity in this market," Cohen
said.

"So you have ComEd on the one hand being the largest buyer of electricity,
and you have Exelon, its parent company, being the largest seller of
electricity. This proposal doesn't address that issue."

Howdy Golfers,

Tee times have been arranged on the East Course (18 holes of golf) at the Broadmoor for Thursday, November 8 (tee times: 1:40pm & 1:48pm).  The price for playing this course is actually $90; slightly cheaper than what is indicated below.  I have arranged for each of your golf charges to be charged to your individual rooms.  Please refer to the list below for additional charges such as, clubs & shoe charges.   I'm hoping to finalize all the activity choices by the end of the week, so please confirm by COB tomorrow Thursday, October 18 that your activity choice will remain golf.

Thanks!

Thanks Luiz.  As a follow-up, I'd like to be on record as saying that the PUCT wasted my time in flying to Austin (when plane travel is not secure, I'd add) and not even listening to my statements.  Why bring us if they had already made the decision?  Also, I don't know who is going to pay for more Market Readiness work in SPP unless AEP agrees to pay our costs.  The customers pay for their activities.

Jean, Pat:

Jim would like us to discuss next steps. 

In particular what should we do regarding Comission decision to delay retail competition - docket 24468? 


As far as Docket 24469 is concerned (SERC-Texas), please confirm the following:

	*	Comission decision to delay competition applies only to 24468
	*	There is an ongoing hearing on 24469 
	*	Today is the deadline for parties to intervene.
	*	However, Enron is not a party in this hearing; nor we filed any motion to intervene
	*	Comission has not requested Enron a specific Request for Testimony
	*	Arguments for delaying competition in SERC are similar to the ones for SPP
	*	Therefore, Comission may decide to delay retail competition as well
	*	Is there anything we can do about it?

Any other ideas?

We will discuss this on the 2:30 pm call Tues.

I think what NERC needs to know is that their job is not done. Big issues were tied into the Stakeholder's recommendation - changes in governance, voting, funding.  The idea of expanding NERC's role is not for the sole purpose of getting NERC to develop business practices - but rather get NERC to recognize the market and commercial needs in its reliability rules.  Presently, NERC focuses on reliability rules and considers commercial impacts as a secondary issue.  This is what the Stakeholders wish to change.  We must make sure that message is not misconstrued by spin-doctors.

To ensure, this, the charter of NERC would need to change and the idea of a Self-Regulated Organization should cease.

Given the actions taken by the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board

NERC taking on an expanded role for the development of business practice
standards in addition to reliability standards.

At the FERC panel discussion last Thursday on standardizing business
practices, it was pretty clear that FERC is not going to make this call,

We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. If you think we can raise issues outside of "unbundling" we should limit our intervention to EES and EPMI.

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing
commercial interest to require "rate unbundling" in anticipation of
direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to
stabilize rates and reduce utility-reated risk).  In this case we are
there to make sure rates are properly unbundled to facilitate AB 661.

By this e-mail, I'm forwarding this to Pat Keene.  He will be your main
contact on Nevada matters for a while.  I'm swamped processing the
filings for the sale of PGE.  My view is that it should be both ENA and
EES.  Our interest is:  (1) we are a potential new electric resource
under AB 661; and (2) these cases will influence whether we can serve
customers under the statute as the unbundled costs incurred by our
potential customers will be determined in this case.

Pat:  What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no
direct access?  I'd rather not say that we that we are representing the
interests of several large consumers in Nevada.  It opens our deals up
for discovery.

We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. If you think we can raise issues outside of "unbundling" we should limit our intervention to EES and EPMI.

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing
commercial interest to require "rate unbundling" in anticipation of
direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to
stabilize rates and reduce utility-reated risk).  In this case we are
there to make sure rates are properly unbundled to facilitate AB 661.

By this e-mail, I'm forwarding this to Pat Keene.  He will be your main
contact on Nevada matters for a while.  I'm swamped processing the
filings for the sale of PGE.  My view is that it should be both ENA and
EES.  Our interest is:  (1) we are a potential new electric resource
under AB 661; and (2) these cases will influence whether we can serve
customers under the statute as the unbundled costs incurred by our
potential customers will be determined in this case.

Pat:  What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no
direct access?  I'd rather not say that we that we are representing the
interests of several large consumers in Nevada.  It opens our deals up
for discovery.

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an "icap/capacity" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states "ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

ComEd seeks rate hike for biz
Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators
Crain's -- October 15, 2001
By Steve Daniels <mailto:sdaniels@crain.com>
Commonwealth Edison Co. is pressing for another big hike in its charges for
delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers.

The Chicago utility's Aug. 31 filing with federal regulators to nearly
double transmission rates - for carrying electricity over its long-haul,
high-voltage lines for these customers - has triggered opposition from state
regulators.

That request followed a June proposal for a 37% increase in distribution
charges, for moving power through the utility's more local, lower-voltage
wires (Crain's, June 11). That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois
Commerce Commission (ICC).

If approved, the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and
distribution costs by about 50% for business customers that leave the
utility for competing power suppliers.

Perhaps more important, the new rates would clear the way for delivery
charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicago-area power users in
three years, when a freeze on ComEd's rates expires.

Transmission and distribution rates account for 20% to 25% of a typical
business customer's total power bill - so, a typical bill could rise as much
as 10% with these increases.

Apart from the bottom-line hit to businesses, ComEd competitors and local
government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent
competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from
offering savings from the utility's bundled rate.

AES NewEnergy Inc., the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more
than 800 customers, says 86% of its customers will see their bills increase
if both proposals are approved.

"What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the
point where bundled (utility) service is cheaper, or it's so close that they
wouldn't bother choosing an (alternative) provider," says Philip O'Connor,
president of AES NewEnergy's Chicago office. "You cannot have competition
being viable when your base of potential customers is so small."

Arlene Juracek, ComEd vice-president of regulatory and strategic services,
counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short
term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a
corresponding decrease in "transition" fees paid to the utility when
customers use another supplier.

The Aug. 31 transmission rate proposal, filed with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission,
which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike.

The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEd's
account methodology, in which the utility would wipe off its books more than
$660 million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask
ratepayers to shoulder that investment again.

'Unjust and unreasonable'

In its filing with FERC, the ICC said the proposed change "would result in
artificially high transmission rates, and an unjust and unreasonable
windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers."

"They're essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the
game," says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill.

ComEd responds that FERC itself - in an order last year pushing utilities to
combine their transmission assets into large, regional networks - said
utilities could consider changing the accounting method.

"ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of (parent
company) Exelon Corp. to receive compensation in accordance with what is
permissible by law," says Steven T. Naumann, ComEd vice-president in charge
of transmission services. "The commission will determine if this is what
they meant (in their order) or if it is not what they meant."

Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, frustrated by ComEd's resistance to sharing
detailed financial data, is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an
outside audit of ComEd's books for 2000. The state attorney general's office
and the Cook County state's attorney's office are joining the city in the
petition, which could be filed as early as Monday, sources say.

The audit, which ComEd opposes, would be aimed at separating ordinary
maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took
in 1999 and 2000 to beef up its distribution system, after acknowledging it
had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades.

The behind-the-scenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government
officials are taking the regulatory proceedings. While the new rates affect
only those customers in the competitive market, they'll be the benchmark
used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in
2005, when the utility's "bundled" rates are no longer frozen.

Setting the rules

"The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future
are getting set now," says William Abolt, commissioner of the city's
Department of Environment. "Basically, the next 36 months are going to set
an awful lot of the fees for the future."

Mr. Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure
ComEd into opening its books, but says it wouldn't be necessary if the
company agreed to do so voluntarily.

A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a
blanket confidentiality agreement - which intervenors in the case, including
the city, aren't likely to sign.

Ms. Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs
associated with its $1.5-billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate

Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers, as well as contractor
expenses, are included in the rates.

"There's no free lunch here," she says.

We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. If you think we can raise issues outside of "unbundling" we should limit our intervention to EES and EPMI.

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing
commercial interest to require "rate unbundling" in anticipation of
direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to
stabilize rates and reduce utility-reated risk).  In this case we are
there to make sure rates are properly unbundled to facilitate AB 661.

By this e-mail, I'm forwarding this to Pat Keene.  He will be your main
contact on Nevada matters for a while.  I'm swamped processing the
filings for the sale of PGE.  My view is that it should be both ENA and
EES.  Our interest is:  (1) we are a potential new electric resource
under AB 661; and (2) these cases will influence whether we can serve
customers under the statute as the unbundled costs incurred by our
potential customers will be determined in this case.

Pat:  What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no
direct access?  I'd rather not say that we that we are representing the
interests of several large consumers in Nevada.  It opens our deals up
for discovery.

Paul,

As I was preparing the petition to intervene, it occurred to me that
information has changed.  Do you want the petition to reflect both ENRON
ENERGY SERVICES, INC. and ENRON NORTH AMERICA.  Also, since you do not
own LV Cogen anymore, what would you like me to put as the reasons for
intervention for these entities.  I have attached a draft petition.  It
needs to be filed on Wednesday.

Thanks for your assistance.

Ben Jacoby told me that the state of Tenn. (through an Energy Policy Committee) has implemented a moratorium on the state reviewing air permits and siting on new IPPs.  Apparently TVA is exempt from the moratorium.  He heard that TVA has been telling the govenor's office that all the new IPPs coming on line in Tenn. are putting TVA's transmission resource at jeopardy.  If this is being said, it is incorrect because, per TVA's "procedures", TVA conducts an interconnection study before connection, so TVA actually approves the interconnection, plus TVA would not let the IPP purchase transmission (or would cut its transmission).

Enron's proposed plant in Tenn. already has the air permit, so Ben is not as concerned about Enron's plants.  However, this type of behavior could show that TVA may be simply keeping IPPs off its system (even though presumably they would pay it revenue -- same problems that we continue to have with VIUs).  Could this be helpful in messaging somehow to DOE, etc. that TVA should be in an RTO?

ACC approved SWG rate order today with following relevant amendments:

   1.  SWG directed to file new imbalance language within 30 days adopting "most expensive slice of gas" methodology proposed by Enron/Midwest

   2. Staff to review filing for compliance with order - has up to 120 days for this, but SWG was warned from bench not to apply current imbalance calculation during that interim period.

   3.  Finding in Recommended Order upholding SWG's current interpretation of imbalance provisions deleted - Enron instructed from bench that it should file a separate complaint for the 2000-2001 winter period which ACC would consider "without preconceptions"

   4.  Language about considering new types of transportation programs in the PGA workshops retained.

On the surface, I consider this at least a partial win.  However, Staff was particularly upset about these amendments and vowed off the record to use the 120 period to try to get the Commission to reverse its position on reducing imbalance charges.  I told Andy Bettwy that if SWG and Staff did not play games with this 30 day filing and acted in good faith during the workshops, we would be willing to discuss the issue of last winter prior to filing anything with the Commission.  He was non-committal.

FERC today issued an Initial Decision in the hearing in the Transwestern case concerning several negotiated rate agreements to which Indicated Shippers and the CPUC had raised objections.  Briefly, the Judge ruled that Transwestern had not exercised market power and that the capacity was advertised and awarded in accordance with Transwestern's tariff.  However, Transwestern must modify its tariff to add a separate provision where all the posting, bidding and award procedures for purposes of awarding capacity are clearly stated.  A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information.

Jeremy --

To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.  

1.	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.

2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.

3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.

4.	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.

If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.

Good mark ups.  Thanks.
Originally, I purposely excluded acknowledging the need for a forum to develop non-physical/pure financial standards.  I was not sure if this was an issue we could win buy-in from other marketers that NERC establish business practices.

However, on the EPSA-NAERO Working Group conference call today, one member suggested we alert NERC and FERC to the fact that "business practices" have the hardest impact on the marketers and IPPs.  And if NERC is going there - then the likes of EPSA and ELCON become the major staekholders in that forum.  I think this is a great twist to the old "reliablity first approach" of NERC  and can give us major leverage.  I will bolster this point in the write-up.

EPSA will draft a letter to be sent to Mike Gent explaining what EPSA members support.  It will be based upon a "checklist" of issues similar to this write-up.  I would like to get this write-up into Mark Bennett's hands to incorporate into the letter and see if other EPSA members can support it.  We may still want to send this write-up directly to Dave Nevius and Mike Gent since, they approached us directly.

Additionally, EPSA members agreed that we should continue the parallel development of EISB and NERC.  But - take an active role in the formation of the 4th quadrant of EISB.  DOE has offered to host a forum for an industry effort to kick-start the 4th quadrant.  Mark Bennett has been talking with Rae McQuade at GISB and she told him that NERC, as an organization, cannot be folded under the EISB umbrella.  FERC would have liked such a simple solution, they want the expertise/experience of NERC - and the fair process of GISB.  So, the challenge is 
a) migrate the NERC expertise into the EISB, or
b) transform the NERC structure into an EISB like structure

NERC is proceeding at Warp Factor 10 in making a transition into the new One-Stop Shop. EPSA members believe that NERC leading this charge will certainly result in the marketers geting the short endf as we did with the Blue Ribbon Panel of a few years ago.  EPSA members want an open and inclusive forum for shaping the new organization.  That is the justification for participating in the DOE sponsored forum - to challenge NERC leading this charge.  This concern will also be expressed in the EPSA letter.

I also spoke with Margaret Morgan (Price Waterhouse and and an EPSA member) to see if she has any ideas, and she too suggested Leonard.

Kevin:

It was good to meet you yesterday.  I decided to watch the Commission
meeting on television so I wasn't at FERC today, but I wanted to pass on
this information to you about possible panelists for the November 2
Infrastructure Meeting in Seattle.

From Governor Geringer's office, a staff level person is Steve Reynolds
(Wyoming Business Council, also staffs the Wyoming Energy Council).  

    His contact information:  (307) 777-2841.  sreyno@state.wy.us.
Steve is great, pro-RTO, pro-economic development.  

Lt. Governor Ohs (Montana) or Steve Snezak.  The Lt. Governor runs
Economic Development for the State.  

    Steve is the Lt. Gov.'s Chief Policy Aide.  406.444.3111.   

    Both Wyoming and Montana are pro-RTO.  

Other options:  Governor Leavitt is pro-infrastructure development, but
probably not a strong RTO supporter.  

        Jeff Burke (State of Utah Energy Office) is probably the
contact in Utah for this matter if you want a staff person.  

        His contact information is:  (801) 538-5428.
nroerp.jburks@state.ut.us

We are still looking for names to represent the financial industry.  I
will let you know what we find out.  Please let me know if you have
questions.

Subject:	RE: Texas Comission supports prompt implementation of SPP

SPP is joining MISO and today MISO said that the merger should be filed at FERC 1Q02.  MISO also told FERC that the same congestion management systems would be used in SPP/MISO, so no seams.  Since MISO is moving toward the market design we want, then really it seems that SPP should be implementing the MISO system for Day1 (which may well be up 12/15/01) and should be right in line with MISO on Day 2 issues (that we like).

However, FERC should not approve SPP as an RTO until it is in with MISO.  I don't see that FERC needs to approve SPP as an RTO in order to allow SPP to finish work on a wholesale energy system because presumably SPP will be using MISO's system.  This summer FERC told SPP to not spend more $ since it was not an RTO yet and it was going off on its own merry way.  Therefore, FERC could say "use MISO's system and specify exactly the minimum that needs to be done on systems in order to have the TX retail settlements done.  This should be done consistent with the no seams, as represented by MISO."  That should satisfy Texas PUC concerns.

My feeling is that FERC is not going to change its RTO plans because of this possible interference from the Texas PUC

A possible scenario is SPP to ask permission to continue the implemantation of a new settlement and congestion management system. A good point for internal discussion is: To what extent  we want to oppose to those changes ? (which seem to be aligned to our recommendations, but those may imply additional SPP resources)

Christi - What do you think?

I would like to schedule a phone call with Nick and the PUCT staff to understand the implication of this...  Maybe he isn't asking for too much, but let's get some clarity before we say anything at FERC.

Can you please set something up with you, Christi, Jean and me for Friday pm and then we'll go outside next week??

You were right. SPP is going to use this episode as a lever to be "promoted" to an RTO. 

Texas is recommending three steps to introduce competition at Texas-SPP. One is described as follows:


*	Support the SPP's efforts to begin wholesale market operations: Mr. Brown, Vice President of SPP, testified that SPP can begin wholesale market operations and complete systems testing by April 1, 2002. He has requested that the SPP Board approve his recommendation to start to wholesale market operations. This Commission should support that process by:

-	Requesting in writing that the SPP Board begin wholesale operations as soon as possible with a target date of completing systems testing by April 1, 2002.
-	Advising FERC of the need to support SPP wholesale market operations. While Mr. Brown testified that the recent July and September Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) orders regarding SPP's start up expenditures will not impede SPP from implementing wholesale market operations, this Commission should advise FERC that the findings from our hearing show the need for FERC to fully support SPP wholesale operations startup.

Jeremy --

To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.  

1.	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.

2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.

3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.

4.	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.

If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.

OK, here are the facts as I understand them:  The CPUC filed petitions for review of the FERC's various refund orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There is an unresolved jurisdictional issue that the petitions filed in the Ninth Circuit are incurably premature because they sought review of orders for which the petitioner was also requesting rehearing.  The current status of the CPUC's Ninth Circuit petitions is that the court has not yet dismissed the petitions as premature and FERC must file the record in the Ninth tomorrow, October 26.  At that point, under Section 313 of the Federal Power Act, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals becomes exclusive, and  FERC will not be able to modify the orders under review except by leave of the court.  FERC has filed, and the CPUC is supporting, a motion for an order permitting FERC to keep jurisdiction over its orders so that it can act on the pending rehearing requests.  By all rights, the court should go along with this, but it's gone on this long.  We are not adversely impacted.  Arguably if FERC loses jurisdiction, the PNW and CA refund cases should come to a complete stop, although this is an unlikely scenario.  I will keep you posted of new developments.  Ray

Please advise regarding the specific request for legal assistance addressing the Florida Sunshine laws.  Please let me know if you would address the request, or if we should proceed with local Florida counsel.

As additional background, Mike Nelson, VP under Phil Lowry,  is heading an initiative for security of the ETS related pipelines.  Enron Corp. security personnel are also participating as a service to ETS.

Selected communications on this matter will be held as confidential.  

Thank you.

The email you forwarded from Rob Wilson included the following request:

	"A side item- beyond the committees interest in hearing from our security personnel, Sue has asked if  an attorney in our 	group could assist her in drafting language, if needed, to provide exemptions/protections to FL sunshine laws regarding 	security related documents."

In discussions with Lou and Colleen, we concluded that I would check with Rick Shapiro, Counsel for Legislative Affairs, to address the request.  Alternatively, we can seek assistance from local Florida counsel (e.g. Ann Longman in Tallahassee FL).  

I will let you know what develops soon.

Also, I understand that Rob Wilson is Manager of Regional Governmental Affairs in Tallahassee.  He mentioned that he had a prepared presentation that he had already used. Perhaps we should consider asking him to begin routing written matters on security through you and me for the time being.  Please ask him for a copy of the presentation before the conference call.  I assume we will meet in advance of the 10/24 call too.

Thank you.

Mike,

Richard Hixson, House staff and Sue  Skelton, Senate staff have requested a meeting w/ our security rep. on the 24th. I suggested a conference call, since the same individual will be the presenter on the 26th. A time has not been established for the call. The conference call would include Sue, Richard , and the House and Senate chairs of each committee, Dudley Goodlette and Ginny Brown -Waite respectively. The intent would be to brief this audience on current security practices on the pipe and initiatives we are participating in w/ other stakeholders i.e. INGAA, DOE, OPS etc... In addition, the chairs want to be aware of information we do not want to share and how to manage the committee Q and A.

 I have indicated the 26th presentation will be succinct, generic, but reassuring . We can manage the Q and A  w/ some general responses regarding our efforts w/ the Florida Law Enforcement Department and heightened state of awareness responses.

 A side item- beyond the committees interest in hearing from our security personnel, Sue has asked if  an attorney in our group could assist her in drafting language, if needed, to provide exemptions/protections to FL sunshine laws regarding security related documents. 

FYI- I have a presentation, I'll be using Monday w/ our PSC which includes bullet points on reliability and security, which should satisfy our needs for the 26th.

I will be out of pocket until next Monday, but could possibly call in if the timing was right.

Mike,

This morning legislative staff asked that I arrange for the appearance of an ETS security personality to address the House and Senate committees examining FL security issues. The committees tentatively plan to meet jointly on October 26th to discuss infrastructure security. There also will be a prehearing meeting on the 25th w/ committee leadership, to discuss the presentations. 

The hearing schedule and agenda continues to be a work in progress as legislative members and staff prepare for a special session to begin on Monday. However, I wanted to alert you to the possibility of needing someone from your shop on at least the 26th. I have seen most everything we've produced to date regarding this issue and drafting a statement will be relatively straight forward. As is always the case, it is the committee Q and A where the practitioner is most helpful.

I will keep you informed of any developments, my contact numbers are 850-350-5018 office;  850-544-6938 cell; 850-668-2782 home

There are materials of the Trans-elect website that details the CMS purchase,  http://www.trans-elect.com/. Under a Q&A section is the following:

Q: Will Trans-Elect put the METC transmission system in an RTO?
A: Yes, in accordance with FERC requirements that all systems must join an RTO.
Q: Which RTO will Trans-Elect choose?
A: Either the Midwest Independent System Organization (MISO) or the Alliance will be selected. Trans-Elect has 40 days from the announcement to make a selection. Trans-Elect is assessing the two organizations to make a determination as to which one will best serve the interests of Michigan consumers.

Looks like there was substance to the Consumers energy rumour.  Consumers are currently part of Alliance, the fact that the new owner wanted to make a decision on RTOs suggests that they are moving to MISO (they would have looked at the ARTO structure as part of due diligence).  Will let you know when the decision is made.

Mike

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

Yes, all REPS are required to report this information on the pilot.  In the pilot there is no PTB, that becomes effective on January 2, 2002, market opening.  These requirements are defined in Substantive Rule 25.431(j)(3)(B) and Project 22384 - Implementation Issues Related to Retail Competition Pilots.  Rebecca Fite is the EES point person who is working with EES internal resources and CSC to obtain the required data.  Please let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

Do all REPs have to report this information - including our customer complaints?  Even if we only serve non-PTB customers?  Who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it?  Do the business people understand this obligation?

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.   

Leslie - where do we start?

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

Are we (or EPSA) taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort?  (There's an article on the filing in today's Electric Power Daily that says they've filed to push back the requirement that they purchase 100% of their power from the competitive market by 2004 to a requirement that they purchase 25% of their power competitively by 2008).

That is true in Option A and Option B.  The key to Option C is that we would have January and February meter read cycle to switch our customer before they would be switched to the affilliate as a customer who did not switch.  Option A and B, EES would not possibly get customers in TNMP and AEP if their meters are read during the first two weeks of the month.  We could send switches for Reliant and TXU for the first two weeks of the month, before the December moratorium.  Does this help?

Best case - We submit on January 2 and the customers get switched on their January meter read date. 

Worst case - We submit on January 2 and the customers get switched on their February meter read date.

Is this correct?

Subject:	RTO Week Comments

Comments on FERC's RTO Week are due on November 3 (Saturday) so we would like to submit comments by the end of this week.  Some of us have briefly discussed the types of comments we may want to submit on behalf of Enron, and the attached list of "Talking Points" are issues that Christi and I put together for Rick during his Washington meetings last week.  These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  We will use the talking points as an outline on issues to raise in our comments.  

We also want to state up front in the comments that FERC is on the right track and that FERC has done a lot of analysis and studies to determine that "right sized" RTOs are in the public interest (this is in response to the negative comments made by the state commissioners that FERC is taking action that has not been proven to be beneficial to consumers).  We also want to make the point that RTO creation is not about retail access and does not impact whether or not a state offers retail choice.

Also attached is a link to FERC Staff's notes from RTO Week.  I have not reviewed these notes yet, but we may also want to respond to these notes in our comments using the same criteria as above; i.e., on areas where we feel that the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  

Please review the Talking Points paper and the Staff Notes, and let me know what you think about this strategy.  I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input.  

I hope to keep these comments limited (10 pages or so), so we need to stay focused -- raise the issue, make our point, and move on.  

Thanks Everyone

Sarah

Subject:	Alliance Generator-Marketing Group - Conference Call (4:30 PM EST) Wednesday, October 31

During its October 24 meeting there was a great deal of discussion at the FERC about the role of transmission companies and the possibility that some activities should be parrcelled out to other entities to perform.  National Grid intends, later this week, to file a white paper in response to those queries.  Before doing so, however, Grid would welcome the opportuity to discuss its filing with you.  We will try to circulate at least an outline of those comments prior to meeting with you, but given the FERC's time constraints we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.  I know that Jim Steffes from Enron has spoken with at least some of you.  Based on our converstion, we have set the conference for 4:30 PM EST on Wedensday, October 31.

Leslie,

I have just completed reviewing the APS filing.  This paper explains much of the observed behavior of APS during the DSTAR (WestConnect) proceedings over the last several months.

The paper is so full of market "scare" tactics it seems appropriate to be reading it during the Halloween season.  The token effort of procuring 270MWs starting 2003 and ramping up to 1670 MWs in 2008 is ridiculous.  The statements that APS generation is somehow more secure and reliable than any generation not owned by APS, using the same grid, and that non-APS generators have little if any responsibility to the "Full-Requirements" customers are all beyond belief.  

The mis-characterization of the problems experienced in CA, OR and WA and the contemptuous citing of "experts" seems typical of the APS distain for deregulation.

The entire filing is more like a guaranteed plan to recover the "Billion" dollars invested by APS, with convenient adjustment clauses every three years.

As you noted earlier today, the Commissioner of the ACC may be more concerned over the APS stock price than truly encouraging open markets and retail access and what better why to help the stock price than to award APS a 14 year contract...look at what the Defense Department did for Lockheed!!!

I spoke with Chris Lackey who met earlier this month with Pinnacle West's (APS subsidiary) head of Trading who told him that PinWest is very conservative (as stated in the filing), their primary function is to support APS and they saw no real opportunities to conduct business with Enron.  However that could change if their petition is denied.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  If this is approved by the ACC I assume it must then go to FERC, do we have an opportunity to intervene with the ACC and/or FERC in regards to this filing?  If we do, I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents.

Kind Regards,

Dave

We should think about it but I wonder if there relation with their utility won't ultimately color the positions they are willing to take.  Let me find out when interventions are due, and we can perhaps discuss it next week in Houston.  We can always intervene separately and then file more substantive comments, etc. jointly.

Leslie,

I had sent a question to my contact in Reliant, it would seem that Reliant is working on an intervention, is this something we would want to join in with?  

As for FERC, in the filing APS I read Commission to mean FERC, when it really was referring to the ACC.

Jim,

Based on your comment, is your concern that if we do intervene and are successful, then APS would find any reason imaginable NOT to do business with Enron?

Thanks,

Dave

is this the "we don't think there is enough wholesale competition in AZ to

customers in AZ to buy our merchant plants with an 11% return" filing?  I
am not involved , but I understand we have a  high level group that is
working on a response to APS' ludicrous filing and will be lobbying at the
ACC and AZ legislature on this one.  It is simply uncomprehensible how APS
could think that it makes sense to make such a filing in the same state
whose commission staff seems to think that there is too much merchant
generation being built.

Subject:	Alliance Bridgeco acquisition of MAIN assets

Jim and Christi,

The attached document is a contract, approved by ARTO's members, covering the sale of MAIN's facilities and transfer of assets to ARTO.  The document raises the question of whether the Alliance is violating FERC's July 12 order by making "business decisions" that should be made by an independent board. You'll recall the language in the July 12 Order -- "We further direct that from the date of this order an independent board be established to make all business decisions for the RTO."  The footnote following that statement references the Grid Florida order, in which the Commission stated: Leasing office space, establishing employee benefit plans, putting accounting systems into place and other basic intrastructure tasks....clearly do not pose independence concerns.  Regarding the acquisition of transmission facilities...., any agreements for such acquisitions that are entered into before the independent Board is selected will be carefully scrutinized."  Thereafter the Commission identified several "more problematic' steps necessary for implementing market design, including the acquisition of software and other systems implementing market design as significant to the future operatioin of the RTO, and required that any acquisition of software or other systems implementing market design not be undertaken until the independent Board has been seated and given approval.

To the extent the facilities conveyed to ARTO via the Asset Purchase Agreement impact market design, the transaction is problematic.  The purchased assets include certain software licenses, but these may not be "market design"-sensitive.

Please let me know if you want the Midwest team to pursue this issue.

Subject: RE: FERC rulemaking on Generator Interconnection


I skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago.  Although I did not see the word "congestion", the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in "but for" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude.  Did I?

I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and "but for" stuff, and then "gives" it to the utility, are there taxes due on the "gift"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned over to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to "waste" on an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dept (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was considering.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC process?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process?  

I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, "all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers.")  On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades), they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it.  And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problems around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considering adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now developing in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the "gift" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmission system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPR?

Subject: FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection


Last night, FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) on Standardizing Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures.  The ANOPR incorporates the ERCOT interconnection procedures, modified by various "best practices" identified by the Commission in an attachment.  A public meeting has been scheduled for November 1st in Washington, although the notice of the meeting is not yet available.  We will forward it when it becomes available.  The ANOPR is attached.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis.  It is probably sufficient to communicate with the Credit department (under Bill Bradford) for wholesale and the EWS Services Group (under Evan Hughes) for retail.

I spoke with Evan Hughes and he is going to have CSC run a report of the tariff obligations.  He will send the info to me and I'll forward to Amr Ibrahim.

Thanks.

Rick:  
As per the discussion this morning, Risk Analytics is currently taking the first pass at our activities to determine if there is any change in the risk exposure that we ought to mitigate.  This may take several days, but perhaps the most pressing one at the moment is the impact of the change in credit rating on the normal business practices including participation in markets, and the cost of transacting in these markets (in case that a financial instrument guarantee is now needed rather than the prerequisite credit rating).  More specifically: 

1.	Credit rating concerns at the wholesale level:  Examples include guarantees of participation in different ISOs and access to transmission systems.
2.	Credit rating concerns at the retail level: Examples include licensing and registration perquisites to market power in the service territory of a distribution company.

I shall keep you posted with progress and with resulting action items.  Of course, please let me know if you have any question/advice.

unspecified time, the District Court judge will rule on that request.  If,
as expected, he denies the stay, TURN will get one more bit at the apple by
appealing that order to the 9th Circuit.  Needless to say, these

Subject: RE: Draft of Joint Comments on Standard Market Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would probably not sign on directly, but would support the document with the additional thoughts --

1.	I don't understand a 6 month collaborative to work through SMD - this only extends the implementation.
2.	Need to push harder on doing away with the Reserve obligation.
3.	I would argue that the RTO need not run a Day Ahead market.  Also, why does a Day Ahead market provide "sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably"?  California has a DA market and people simply did not participate.  The argument that a DA market replaces a Unit Committment process doesn't seem complete?
4.	The position and implications on CM and RT market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear - does this mean that Enron supports delaying all RTO "activity" (e.g., OASIS, single tariff, rates) until CM is complete?
5.	What is a "point-to-point" financial hedge?  Does this imply node-to-node?  Can we include some discussion of market "hubs"?  How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge?  Also, what about the allocation or auction process for FTRs?  How should existing transmission arrangements be managed?
6.	Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs. Rolled-In?  Will this cause any heartburn for ETS?  What about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation?  Should this be borne by the system or the generator?

My thought is that this is a big piece and Enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on.  Sarah Novosel is working on Enron comments.

All:

After I sent out the draft late yesterday afternoon, I found out that FERC
had extended the deadline from November 5 to "as soon as reasonably
possible."  Obviously, we would like to provide everyone with sufficient
time to review the draft and get approvals.  We also have a saying in
Chicago - "Vote early and often" and at least with respect to the "vote
early" we think it is important to get comments in early.

Therefore we now suggest that instead of replying by the end of today as to
whether you can sign or not sign and what must be added or deleted for you
to join, we suggest responding by the end of Friday.  This will allow us to
circulate another draft and get comments in by the middle of next week and
have considerable influence on the process.

Thanks for your help under these changing circumstances.

Subject:	Re: SW Gas

We have yet to receive a final order.  I would prefer to have it in hand before a complaint is filed.  There is another year to go on the statute of limitations, and thus aside from the natural desire to get money sooner rather than later (and especially while Commissioner Spitzer is still on the Commission, which should be through the end of 2002), there is no particular rush.  Also, your "coalition" partner in the war on SWG imbalance terrorism, Midwest United, has also authorized a complaint, so there is the possibility to again share the costs of any such proceeding.

I didn't expect the merchant generators to be thrilled with the APS filing, but then I'm sure they wouldn't like a complete repeal of the electric oompetition rules, which at least one Commissioner seems to favor, or an order preventing any divestiture of APS generation and any competitive bidding, which is another distinct possibility from a Commission that has effectively lost its faith in competition.  Hopefully the Texas people at least read the application this time.  I can also tell you that APS is quietly upset that the merchant generators say nothing when SRP does far worse things, or when Citizens gets a total waiver of the same regulation for which APS seeks a partial waiver, or when TEP files their plan (which will happen shortly) making APS' look like a wild pro-market experiment.  In other words, APS takes a lot of grief not because it is perceived as the most anti-competitive incumbent (even our worst enemy would privately agree we are probably the best in this state), but simply because it is the most visable.

Has the ACC issued an actual order onthe SW Gas?  I  have not seen
anything.  I have to formal go ahead on filing the complaint for the
refund, so let me know what your strategy is for that.  I assume we
should run the numbers with some accuracy, and I can have the number
crunchers here do that.

Your APS filing is not being too well received in the hinterlands
(Texas) from what I hear.  Expect some noise.

Hope you are enjoying the World's Series.

Importance: High


I don't agree Edison's premise -- that "direct access customers contributed just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers." We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to buy power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I will explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeoffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their billions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in direct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs alone -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject to any presumed "undercollection."

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from T&D. So, they did a "top-down" calculation.  This meant that there had to be a "credit" put on the bills of DA customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. So, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled customers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed their tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got nowhere, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our argument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought we had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to receive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated with bundled customers. It seems as if we should be able to prosecute this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an attorney) 

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

Sue

Sue --

I agree with your arguments.  The other problem with SCE's analysis is that they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money.  

What California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates for 4 years.  All of the margin they "earned" was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access.  If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, this implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs.  

The entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate.

Subject:	Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion, Nov. 20..... 

RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

DATE - TIME - LOCATION

Tuesday, November 20 
8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
EB 8C1

Subject:	Credit Rating Isuses - ISOs



I am concerned with the credit worthiness issues with the various ISOs, and I am seeking your comments/advice on the appropriate action items that GA should take to assist the various sections in Enron to comply with the requirements in an expedient, proactive,  and cost-effective manner.    
1.	Perhaps I should start by mentioning that in NYISO, and PJM (and I assume the same for the rest), there is an obligation on the market participants for informing the ISO (some in writing, within 5 business days as the case in PJM) of any Material change in its financial condition.  The issue here should GA assist in communicating this change.   
2.	Does the Team agree that there is a need to determine exactly what are the conditions for posting a financial instrument.  How the instrument size is calculated (hence the total additional obligation)? how does it change with the change in our business volumes, or credit rating? are the terms for the financial instruments applied consistently to all market agents or just on Enron?
3.	What is the best approach to assist RAC in prioritizing which financial instrument should be dealt with first, if there is a prioritization process.  

I do have language for PJM, and NYISO if you would like to have access to them.  

I look forward for your comments and suggestions

Many thanks and Brgrds

PS:  Material change is a defined term in PJM, and includes a downgrade of a long or short term debt rating by a major rating agency; being placed on a credit watch with negative implications by a major rating agency.

Subject:	Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion, Nov. 20..... 

RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

DATE - TIME - LOCATION

Tuesday, November 20 
8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
EB 8C1   

Video conference and teleconference capabilities are available.

Sue --
 
My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  
 
Thanks,

Yes, but I think we may lose that rating.  What is the impact if that were to occur?  Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.

Harry: 

Gloria and I agree that the situation in Texas could be currently described as "reasonable" for the time being; this taking into consideration the "Triple B" from S&P of today.  Here is the analysis.

1.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.1  purports that a deposit for a competitive retailer shall not be required provided that the retailer has not defaulted within the past 24 month.  If it defaults, then a deposit is required.  Gloria and I understand that we did not default. 
2.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.2 purports that the size of deposit is 1/6 of the estimated annual amount to be billed under the tariff.
3.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.2 purports that a form of deposit is any affiliate guaranty from an affiliate with long-term unsecured credit ratings of not less than "BBB-" or "Baa3" (or equivalent) from S&P or Moody's, respectively.  It is important to mention that other forms of security may be mutually agreed to.  

Kindly advise if you have any question.

Subject: EPSA MBR Authority Leave Behind
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:

1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.

2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?

3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  

4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.

5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.

6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?

Subject:	RE: Call Regarding Prehearing Conference on Our Negative CTC complaint

OK.  Haven't heard back from Bob, but we may be able to avoid the call.  Mike Day got in touch with Edison's attorney this morning and here's the end result.

Edison has agreed to tell the judge on the 7th that, with respect to the complaints we've filed, they agree to take them off calendar until and unless parties ask to put them back on calendar.
Edison will  take the view that the proceedings underway at the commission (and presumably attempts to "settle" with parties) will resolve the issues in the complaint.
The assumption from out end is that the status quo remains intact.  That is, we will continue to pay the Commission, not Edison, for T&D charges during the "time out" on our complaints.  
Mike and Jeanne will make sure that this critical piece, i.e., that we continue to place payments in escrow, will remain intact as part of the "time out."  If it turns out there are any doubts about this aspect, we'll likely need regroup and reconsider our options.

If anyone has any questions or concerns please speak up, and/or if folks would still like to have a very brief call to discuss, we can do that and ensure that Bob is kept in the loop and can weigh in when he returns.

Comments/thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

CMTA PARTICIPATES IN GOVERNOR'S ECONOMIC SUMMIT 
Press Release 

Today at Governor Davis' Economic Summit at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, the California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA) proposed three recommendations to help bring immediate relief to the state's faltering economy. 

"California is in a dramatic economic decline," said CMTA President Jack M. Stewart.  "Manufacturing employment is down 63,000 this year and by more than 10,000 jobs in September alone. The state's unemployment rate has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months, peaking at its present 5.4 percent." 

"It's time for the state to implement new policies that will incent investment sooner rather than later," said Stewart. 

CMTA today will introduce proposals to: 

Implement a Sales Tax Exemption <http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201> ( <http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201>) on Manufacturing, Processing and Telecommunications Equipment 
Reduce Electricity Rates <http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201> ( <http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201>) and Provide Customer Choice in Energy 
Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees <http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201> ( <http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201>) and Taxes 

These initiatives will comprise the association's focus in the coming months, and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members. 

"The costs associated with a battered business community are not only measured by stock-tickers and cable financial networks.  They are the human toll of jobs that are lost, mortgages that fail and families that go with less," added Stewart.  "These measures will restore confidence in every manufacturers' ability to remain productive and allow them to reinvest in the state's workforce." 

California's manufacturing sector currently produces: 

80 percent of state exports 
One sixth of state payroll 
40 percent higher wages than the statewide average 
And for every manufacturing job, an additional 1-3 jobs are produced 

"These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help California through this economic crisis," concluded Stewart. 
  

BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS 

According to just released data from Venture Economics and  the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture capital investment in the Bay Area during the 3rd quarter dropped 27 percent over the 2nd quarter of this year. Investment has slowed significantly this year and the 3rd quarter investment is 74 percent lower than the $9.3 billion high reached during the 2nd quarter of 2000. 

The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for the 3rd quarter. Venture capitalists invested $7.7 billion nationally during the quarter, down 31 percent from the previous quarter, and 73 percent from the $28.5 billion high of last year. 

"Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors, the venture industry will persevere. Veterans in our industry recognize this downturn as part of the long-term venture capital cycle. Real value can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas through," commented Mark Heesen, NVCA President. 
  

CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE 

At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) and other employer organizations, Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB 1197 by Senator Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles). The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child, parent or spouse in any absence control program 

Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child, parent, or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions.  The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds, high temperature, sore throats etc., that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care.  However, employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions. 

When employees don't show up or show up late for work, it negatively impacts production.  In order to mitigate this problem, employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling, suspension and termination.  After the above provision became law, employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision, so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse.  SB 1197 would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem. 

In addition to insuring that production schedules are met, the main reason for an employer's absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled and/or on time.  Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning.  For example, if an employee's attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays, Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes, no disciplinary action could be taken. In other instances, it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late. 

SB 1197 would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy.  Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees.  CMTA discussed with legislators the counter-productive nature of restricting an employer's ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit. When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations, it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program. 

CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those employees who have trouble getting to work under SB 1197 and could end up eliminating the benefit for all employees.  CMTA applauds Governor Davis's veto of the bill.

             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject to

Subject:	Re: California - Credit Worthiness requirements

Amr,
The situation with the California ISO is complicated by the fact that they recently had to face a loss of creditworthiness from PG&E and Southern California Edison. In an ammendment to the the ISO Tariff, the ISO proposed revisions to the tariff that would in effect waive the sanctions ot the ISO Tariff's creditworhiness requeriments for certain entities that were creditworthy as of January 3, 2001 but were about to lose the Approved Credit Rating that established their creditworthiness. This only applies to purchases using their own generation and transmission, but opened a pandora box in the evaluation of creditworthiness for market participants in California. In addition, the ISO Tariff did not have procedures in place to admit guarantees from third parties to back energy, ancillary services and grid management charges. A process was incorporated to this effect recently to allow SCE and PG&E buy power backed by California Department of Water Resources.
In any event, each Scheduling Coordinator (SC), Utility Distribution Company (UDC) or Metered Subsystem (MSS) must maintain an approved Credit Rating or provide in favor of the ISO one fo the following forms of security for an amount to be determined by the SC, UDC or MSS in the form stated in the Tariff:
An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit confirmed by a bank or financial institution reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional surety bond posted by an insurance company reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional guarantee which has and maintains an Approved Credit Rating;
A cash deposit standing to the credit fo an interested bearing escrow accoint maintained at a bank or financial institution designated by the ISO;
A certificate of deposit in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO; or
A payment bond certificate in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO;
Letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, payment bond certificates, escrow agreements and certificates of deposit shall be in such form as the ISO may reasonably require from time to time by notice to SC, UDCs or MSSs. SCs, UDCs or MSSs that do not maintain an approved credit rating will not be allowed to submit a schedule to the ISO, and the ISO will reject any schedule submitted if the security amount is not deposited. If an outstanding liability exceeds 90% of the required security amount, a notification by the ISO will be issued to cover the security within 15 days.
As of March 13, 2000, an approved credit rating with respect to market obligations, is defined as an entity maintaining at lest an A2/P2 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating or a A3/A- (or equivalent) long-term credit rating from a national credit rating agency. Market obligations are Imbalance energy, Ancillary Services, Grid Operations Charge, Wheeling Access Charge, High Voltage Access Charge, Transition Charge, Usage Charges and FERC Annual Charges. I suppose day-ahead energy charges are also included since the dissolution of the PX, although I could not find an explicit reference to this issue in the regulations.
SCs, UDCs or MSSs  must maintain A1/P1 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating for the Grid Management charges, or the charges the ISO makes to fund its operations.
If you have any questions, please let me know. Regards,
ALF

Gentlemen,
 
At the ESC meeting last week, some discussion was brought forth about the voting model and bylaws of the ESC.  I joined a small task group to investigate various structures and such.
 
I have attached a strawman set of Bylaws for the ESC that I have written.  I would like to get your input on these items as soon as possible.  The small focus group will be working to determine an appropriate model, and will be using the NERC 8-sector model as its starting point.  I would like to propose this 5-sector model instead, as I think it more closely aligns with the way business works and builds the approriate motivational structure.  There may need to be more detail in the sector definitions, as right now they are somewhat loose.
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.
 

Andy

I presume that both filings, the one on third party guarantees, and the one on lower credit ratings, were approved by FERC. Both were approved by the Board and both are in the ISO Tariff, the first is ammendment 36 and the second ammendment 29. I could not find the actual FERC order in the millions of hits in the very imperfect search engine of the CAISO. Please advise. Regards,

Jim,

Just to let you know, Ray and I spoke with Marc Racicot today about WestConnect and the problems associated with the filing made on Ocotber 15.

We emphasized the problems with overall lack of independence, lack of resolution on congestion management and market monitoring despite a four year process to do so.  We also touched on significant participating transmission operator involvement in the planning and interconnection process as well.

Mr. Racicot seemed very appreciative of our comments and noted that many of the governors he speaks with still do not have a full understanding of the implications of forming an RTO and will typically follow the path of least resistance.  Having been made aware of our concerns will help him better craft his message to this group.  He is interested in receiving any bullet points or summaries of any filing we make in regards to WestConnect.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Gas deregulation: unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition, lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians. It hasn't. 
MATTHEW C. QUINN 
STAFF 

Nov. 4, 2001 
Atlanta Journal/Atlanta Constitution 
Home 
Page E.1 
(Copyright, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2001) 

Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas, there's widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed. 

When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 1.5 million homes and businesses, the goal was to drive prices down and improve service. 

Instead, here's what resulted: A relentless wave of billing errors, confusion and customer service complaints. Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged. Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winter's record cold. Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills. Three marketers have gone bankrupt, reducing competition. Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on.

The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong. No easy fixes are at hand.

"No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what they've had to go through," said Paula G. Rosput, chief executive of AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers.

Rosput, who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way, now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably "swimming against the tide."

Georgia's relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit, she said. Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly.

"There's plenty of blame to go around here," she said, noting that "never in the history of Georgia" has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide.

Gov. Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass. He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January. Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers, but he has "profound concerns" about the impact on consumers.

Barnes said he's not out to scrap deregulation. That's a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature, along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures.

The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in. According to Atlanta Gas Light, more than 50,000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected.

The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored, except in certain hardship cases.

The PSC has allocated $10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills, and the federal government has kicked in $15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers. 

As a result, social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers. The Sullivan Center, a southwest Atlanta nonprofit, is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills.

Many of them haven't paid since last winter's frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country. 

The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term. When the moratorium expired in April, more than 220,000 customers were targeted for disconnection, and marketers were stuck with a reported $100 million in bad debt. Since then, 142,000 homes and businesses have been shut off; 87,500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills.

Nancy D. Coveny, executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry, which offers assistance to low-income residents, said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies. Before deregulation, "it was a lot easier" to straighten out problems, Coveny said. "We would call Atlanta Gas Light. We had relationships."

High prices

Jessie Champion, 54, of southwest Atlanta, said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a $2,081 bill dating back months.

Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light, and was told by the company that "the computer messed up." She's been using an electric heater for her household, which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son. 

Catherine Land-Waters, vice president/customer service at Georgia Natural Gas, said Champion's service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments. She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored.

Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move. She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas, even though she sent a check. Service was restored two days later, but only after she "yelled and screamed" and complained to the PSC. "I have to have gas," she said. "I have seven children." 

Dave Benfield, a spokesman for Infinite, said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection. The small, Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment.

"If people don't pay us in 45 days, they get a notice," Benfield said. "In most cases they pay."

The PSC has logged more than 12,000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing, billing inaccuracies, disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances. That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications.

"People aren't being treated right," says PSC member Stan Wise, a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system. 

Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out, and complaints to the PSC have tapered off.

What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas. When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months, residential prices charged by marketers remained high. Last week, wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year.

Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers. The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch. 

It's not clear "how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation," said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley.

Reeling from bad debt

Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation. Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not.

But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price, which was not heavily promoted as an option. 

A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities. The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was $37.12, compared with an average of $27.03 for six regulated utilities in nearby states. Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average.

But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service, plus Atlanta Gas Light's distribution charges. PSC member Robert Baker says AGL's charges, which account for 40 percent of typical bills, may be partly to blame for high bills.

On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to $52.5 million a year above what's authorized, the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates. AGL, meanwhile, claims it's entitled to a rate increase of up to $48 million.

With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers, it's hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks.

Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas. What was supposed to be Georgia's gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted. That touched off an array of billing problems and errors. When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed, many consumers, already angered by the billing problems, blamed deregulation --- and didn't pay their bills. 

While those problems were evolving in Georgia, California had its electricity implosion. Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation they'd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services, including electricity and telecommunications. But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity. "California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power," said Warren Darby, retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia, S.C.

When Georgia's moratorium on shut-offs expired in April, marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated $100 million in bad debt. Instead of building market share, they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers.

"You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality," Darby said.

Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co., recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas. The crash program by Georgia's No. 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints. Darby said Shell is "circling the wagons."

Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia "has not been an exciting profit picture for us," but he insists his company has no plans to pull out. He added, however: "Unless things get better, no company can survive this."

Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer, has been one big headache for AGL Resources, its parent, which recently took a $13.5 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner. "It's not been a good business for us," said Rosput of AGL.

No. 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported $4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year, or about $1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt. The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses. The company says it's in for the long term.

New Power Co. made a late and aggressive entry into Georgia's natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets. Wall Street didn't like the idea. The company's stock has plunged from $21 a year ago to less than $1. Its top financial backer, Enron Corp., last month wrote down about $270 million of its investment. But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that it's not planning to pull out.

Still, there's concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits. The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business. 

The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight. The top four control 94 percent of the market.

PSC member Baker already sees an "oligopoly" with limited competition. Consumer choice "is supposed to be the hallmark" of deregulation, said Commissioner David Burgess. Instead, he said, "consumers have less and less."

'Re-regulation' calls

So far, no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems. 

Calls for "re-regulation" are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January. Already, a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship.

"We can't let Georgia consumers suffer for another year," said state Sen. Sonny Perdue of Bonaire, who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas. Perdue, the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law, is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. He would oppose Barnes. 

State Rep. Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus), the main House sponsor of the '97 law, said he's concerned about gas prices, but he's not sure re-regulation is "doable at this point."

Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance. 

"We believe a year from now, weather permitting, that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have," saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love.

Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems, including dilemma No. 1: "If it's re-regulated, who takes the ball?" says PSC Chairman Lauren "Bubba" McDonald Jr.

Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 1.5 million customers, which was turned over to marketers.

Then there's the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a "bailout" to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into. 

One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers. That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated.

Other measures could include new standards for billing, customer service and meter reading; more authority for the PSC, including emergency power to regulate prices; reducing the sales tax for gas bills; and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers.

But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for "fixing" deregulation. In fact, there may be no good fix.

Rosput said she's "prepared to get to a solution," but like everyone else, she doesn't have an answer.

"It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship," she said, "and there's no safe shore or good place to land."

I am concerned with the credit worthiness issues with the various ISOs, and I am seeking your comments/advice on the appropriate action items that GA should take to assist the various sections in Enron to comply with the requirements in an expedient, proactive,  and cost-effective manner.    
1.	Perhaps I should start by mentioning that in NYISO, and PJM (and I assume the same for the rest), there is an obligation on the market participants for informing the ISO (some in writing, within 5 business days as the case in PJM) of any Material change in its financial condition.  The issue here should GA assist in communicating this change.   
2.	Does the Team agree that there is a need to determine exactly what are the conditions for posting a financial instrument.  How the instrument size is calculated (hence the total additional obligation)? how does it change with the change in our business volumes, or credit rating? are the terms for the financial instruments applied consistently to all market agents or just on Enron?
3.	What is the best approach to assist RAC in prioritizing which financial instrument should be dealt with first, if there is a prioritization process.  

I do have language for PJM, and NYISO if you would like to have access to them.  

I look forward for your comments and suggestions

Many thanks and Brgrds

Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  

On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??

Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?

Subject:	Lunch with Gail McDonald (MD PSC)

Linda Robertson and I had lunch with Gail McDonald, Maryland PSC commissioner, yesterday in Baltimore.  Linda knows Gail and her husband (it's an old Oklahoma thing), so Linda arranged the lunch for us.

On the RTO front, Gail told us that the MD PSC is not opposed to one Northeast RTO.  They see it as inevitable but they do have concerns about the "contamination" problem (i.e., PJM is a good, functioning ISO, New York is not, and Maryland does not want PJM to be contaminated by New York).  They were particularly troubled by FERC's statements that "best practices" from New York and New England should be included in the new Northeast RTO.

I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position.  I said we believe PJM is the best market in the U.S. and the ISO is a sound, independent organization.  I said our traders like the liquidity of the western hub, and our goal has been to spread PJM throughout the rest of the Northeast.  I told her that we too are concerned about contamination from New York, which is why we worked so hard to endorse a plan that put PJM firmly in control of the development of the new RTO market design and of the new RTO.  We discussed how New York and New England are opposed to weighting the board towards PJM, but that we believe (and presumably Maryland would support this position) that the new board must be weighted by PJM board members to ensure proper implementation of the PJM model.  At a minimum, PJM must be in charge of implementing the new market design.

Gail also said the MD PSC thought the seams process should be worked out before a single RTO is in place.  I explained to her the problems of the MOU and that we (and most market participants) do not believe that the three ISOs will ever be able to work out the seams issues as long as they remain separate entities.  She was not familiar with the MOU process but seemed to agree that if the seams were not resolved by the entities over the last two years, that it is unlikely that they will ever been resolved.

Gail is going to NARUC next week (she's on the gas committee, which Nora asked her to be on earlier this year), and we urged Gail to find Nora and discuss these issues in more detail.  We told Gail that Nora (coming from the Pennsylvania PSC) understands and agrees with the concerns raised by Gail, but that Nora seems to believe that the way to fix the problem is to implement PJM throughout the Northeast.

Gail also asked about the State/FERC initiative and asked what happened with the Regional Reliability Organization concept.  I told her I will look in to it and get back to her.

As we were finishing lunch, Gail said our discussion was very helpful for her to better understand the issues surrounding a Northeast RTO.  She also said she will try and "turn down the rhetoric" from the PSC.  Linda and I again encouraged Gail to talk with Nora next week, and we said we hoped that we (Enron) could work together with the PSC to ensure that the right RTO is implemented in the Northeast.

Linda and I were quite pleased with the lunch and are hopeful that we can get something going with Maryland.  Ending Maryland's opposition to a Northeast RTO would be extremely helpful in the political debate that seems to be taking place.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

Janel,
 
The paper is OK.
 
My only comments would be, as far as an RTO offer non-discriminatory access to transmission, I think without the word "comparable" the Participating Transmission Owners (PTOs) of the proposed westConnect would say, yes, they offer non-discriminatory access...to whatever is left over after they distribute the majority of the rights to the incumbants!  Is that comparable, in my opinion no, which is one of the reasons why I inserted the word comparable.  I can see where that may be nit-picking, but that was my reason for adding it.
 
As far as my comment about Governance.  The governance of WestConnect, a for-profit TransCo, is severely biased to the favor of the PTOs.  Perhaps it is just their version of a for-profit Transco that is not favorable to other market-participants, but I would be cautious in citing a for-profit RTO as a preferred model, a for-profit Transco operating within a non-profit - Independent RTO, seems to be a more reasonable.  But these judgements are based on my understanding of the WestConnect.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Dave

Thank you very much for the feedback and edits to the Well-Designed RTO paper.  I've made the bulk of the changes you suggested except for the section on page 1 - Which constitutes a well-designed institutional structure for an RTO?
 
Each of you had significant issues with this section.  I get the feeling that we should eliminate it altogether but want to clear that with you before I do so.  Do you have alternative suggestions?  
 
Other than that particular section, I would really appreciate if you reviewed the attached one more time (with the changes that were made) and let me know if you are comfortable with how it is evolving.
 
thank you.

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, "release the $1 million tomorrow."  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

As requested.  The method by which the $1 million security requirement for
agency billing on Enron Energy Services' current population is explained
below.  This is a consistent approach at calculating security requirements
for agency billing for ESCOs participating in our service territory.  If you
have questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Jim-

We are working very hard to have an operational and reliable EDI environment in New York. So far, we are covering the three main billing scenarios (UDC-bill ready, UDC-rate ready and ESCO-bill ready) that we may choose and switch as needed. EDI billing is not ready yet but we expect having it implemented (testing included) at the most by May 2002. I'll keep you posted on the latest developments. Let me know if you need any questions. Thanks, Vinio

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, "release the $1 million tomorrow."  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Janine - my thoughts -

On the rate cases, I don't think we need any change of direction.  For the IP case, our argument is just the legal one of whether they can discriminate.  And there were a lot more parties involved with ComEd than IP, even though the issues are basically the same, so I wouldn't worry there about perception.

The bigger deal may be our protest of Dynergy's protest of Com Ed's treatment of Firm LD for marketers.  The filing has already been made, so we should stay on track.

Given the recent developments with the potential merger between Enron and Dynergy, there are a few policy questions in Illinois for which we would like guidance:

Illinois Power

We have intervened in the delivery service tariff case and are handling it primarily inhouse and solo - no other marketers.  Yesterday, we filed a Reply (greatly toned down - sticking to the facts only) to IP's memo contra our Motion to Dismiss.  URM decided not to do testimony so at this point we contemplate not showing up at the hearing and briefing only.  Recall that the issue is that to raise distribution tariffs for only unbundled customers taking service from an alternative supplier is unlawful and also anticompetitive and discriminatory, etc.  Our book impact could be around $2 million, I believe should IP get the full increase.  Moreover, it would stifle future competition.  

query:  Should our course of action be altered?


ComEd

ComEd parallels IP except that it is going forward first.  We made the same arguments on the Motion to Dismiss, which was denied by the Judge.  Our plan is to seek rehearing with the full Commission and to point out that the ICC filed comments at FERC with respect to increasing only unbundled transmission rates that were fully consistent with our arguments respecting distribution!

The case is currently in hearing and we have an Enron witness testifying.

In a separate move in this case, the City of Chicago and Cook county have filed a separate action requesting an audit and investigation of ComEd's books and records alleging basically that ComEd is seeking double recovery of costs.  If we intervened it might be possible to do so without paying any of the costs, assuming Blackhawk and AES/New Energy agree (we have done this for them in the past).
Upsides are that it would be viewed positively by the City of Chicago and Cook County as supporting them.  Downsides are that this really gets into rate issues that in previous RCR discussions we were told to stay away from and secondly, do we really want to be supporting an audit and investigation of another utility's books and records right now, given Enron's position?  

The last point is whether there is a perception problem in being more aggressive with Com Ed than IP on the rate discrimination issue, should we decide to take that path.

We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).

I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.

In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.

I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.

Thanks,

Jim

PS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status.

We are not managing bonds, etc.  This is a market entry requirement and should be documented by Product Development/Services upon entering new markets.  We had a meeting earlier this week with Vicki Sharp and came to general agreement that this was a Services/Regulatory maintenance requirement.  Will follow up and make sure they are pulling this together.  This is one of the issues I have been hammering on re: new product development/new market entry - I want proof of all data requirements/costs/license requirements/processes before new products are released and markets are entered.  In the past, I believe sign offs have occurred without a complete understanding of the requirements.  I have refused to sign any new products until Product Development can prove the above exists - even for markets where we are already doing business.

Why did this expire without renewal? Who is managing this specific issue and what is the status of the bond renewal? I would like a matrix outlining each state we do business in for gas and power, the requirements/obligations for EES to be a retail seller (gas & power)
 in each of those states, and status of those requirements (i.e.- dates when next action is needed). I'd also like the name of the individuals responsible for ensuring these requirements are met listed beside the states. I'd like to have this pulled together within a week.

Subject:	IMPORTANT: Illinois - Creditworthiness Issues

Unlike TX, creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers (ARES) in IL is not uniform accross utility lines. The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.

Enron's Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody's)
General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.

Registration Under SubPart B:
EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications
	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or

	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 
	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES' revenue for last fiscal year; or
	
	3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES's revenue for the last fiscal year; or

	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES' contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or
	
	5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an "A" rated financial 	insitution; or
	
	6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.

Enron's Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody's), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.

IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES's ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.

Single Bill Option:
Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:
	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO

	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an "A" rating

	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)
	
	4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.
Enron's Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp's current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. 

Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.

IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.

IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP's service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.

Thanks.

It makes sense for Gloria and Rebecca to get together (I am available to talk tomorrow and have asked Gloria to set something up).  

Also, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).

On the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.  The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.  Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?

Call if anyone has any questions.

Evan,

Attached is a matrix that identifies our current State Licenses.  We work directly with EES Legal for license renewals and new registrations.  As Craig has indicated below, our records indicate we are current for both Licensing and Bond Requirements in Illinois at a State Level.

As EES is currently pursuing Supplier Billing Option (SBO) behind Commonwealth Edison, we will have to comply with the credit worthiness requirements outlined by Gloria, but my understanding of her email indicates we currently meet these standards and will only be required to supply funds in the event our credit rating drops further.

 << File: certificationsEESI.ppt >>  << File: certificationsEEMC.ppt >> 

Please feel free to contact either of us with questions.

Rebecca

Evan,

As you know, the license application function was migrated to the Service Desk in August 2001.  This activity was previously maintained by Beth Gooden.  In any case, our records show that EES is current and compliant.  EES was granted a retail license in August 1999.  To maintain the license, EES must submit an annual "Re-certification" and keep a bond current.  A Re-certification application was submitted on 1/31/01 and the  bond was extended through 6/1/02.

I hope this answers your concerns.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.



Craig

DATE: November 8, 2001

RE: Industry Meeting Regarding the Wholesale Electricity
      Standard Organization

The Department of Energy (DOE) is sponsoring an industry wide meeting facilitated by EPSA, ELCON and the National Energy Marketers Association.  This forum will be held on December 7th, and is designed to provide an opportunity for open discussion on the organizational structure needed to represent the wholesale electric interests in the development of market-based standards and types of standards that should be addressed.  As with the previous industry-wide meetings held on standards development activities for the wholesale and retail natural gas and electric topics, the DOE has graciously offered its facilities for the meeting site.  The meeting specifics are below and a draft agenda is attached.

WHERE:	Department of Energy
	Forrestal Building
                1000 Independence Avenue, S.W.
	Washington, D.C. 20585

ROOM:	Large Auditorium, Room GE-086

WHEN:	Friday, December 7th
 	10:00 a.m.  to  5:00 p.m.

The nature of the debate should address the framework for an organization whose role would be to develop wholesale electric standards, including scope of activity, segments for each of the industry quadrants, and any additional key principles that are necessary.  As supporting information for the meeting is prepared, which would include a more detailed agenda, it will be posted on the GISB web site, (www.gisb.org) and sent out to both the Regulatory Affairs Committee and the NERC Working Group.  A draft agenda for the meeting is attached.

If you are unable to attend the meeting, or would like to provide written comments in addition to attendance, please provide them to the GISB office via email (contact:  gisb@aol.com) by December 3rd.  The work papers and comments received by December 3rd will be posted on GISB's web site (www.gisb.org) and emailed to all registered participants on December 4th.  The meeting will be transcribed and transcripts will be available for purchase.

The DOE has security procedures for visitors, so those intending to attend the meeting should notify the GISB office (contact: gisb@aol.com) by end of business Monday, December 3rd and provide the following information:

? Name of Attendee
? Company Represented
? Phone Number
? Email Address
? Fax Number
? Country of Citizenship

In addition to its normal security process, the DOE has additional security measures if should you bring in cell phones or laptop computers.  The auditorium has very limited number of power outlets for laptops, and it is advised not to bring them to the meeting.  Should you need to bring in a cell phone or a laptop, you should allow more time for a longer procedure for checking through security.   The auditorium has a seating capacity of 200, with limited standing room.  An attendance list will be provided to the DOE to facilitate the sign in procedures, and will be made available at the meeting.

Please feel free to contact Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 if you have any questions or comments.

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a "public interest" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and "load up" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific "Christmas tree ornaments."

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a "rubber stamp" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

When is  Bigger Better?
The Acquisition of Orion by Reliant
The  possible acquisition of Orion Power, the owner of many plants that serve the  Pittsburgh area, by Reliant Resources is the fifth major transaction affecting  Pennsylvania's generation and electric service since 1996. Reliant Resources'  attempt to buy Orion Power, however, raises issues not seen before in other  transactions. 
Those transactions - the PECO Energy and Unicom merger,  the GPU and First Energy merger, the sale of GPU's power plants, and Duquesne  Light Company's swap of plants with First Energy and subsequent purchase by  Orion - did not increase the market power of a particular generation owner.  
Why not? All the other transactions involved companies operating in  different markets, or companies that did not own generation, or sale of power  plants from one company to one or more companies. In fact, taken together these  transactions reduced consumer costs, protected rate caps, and decreased stranded  costs. They also led to important environmental improvements like new pollution  control investments and support for renewable energy.
Reliant Resources,  however, already owns generation within PJM and the purchase of Orion would add  generation to its PJM share, once Duquesne joins PJM West. For this reason, the  transaction should be carefully reviewed and used to formulate a new policy  concerning consolidation of generation assets within a single  market.
Specifically, regulatory bodies should make increased demand  response a condition for any transaction that increases generation consolidation  as demand response strongly mitigates market power. Funds should be devoted to  ensuring that all consumers with a load of 50 kilowatts and above are equipped  with time-of-use meters. This measure is necessary, as the single biggest  regulatory mistake to date in electricity restructuring is the failure to make  demand response a central part of restructuring. Without it, workably  competitive markets will not develop or be sustained.
Apart from  increasing demand response, regulators and the Office of Consumer Advocate  should get answers to the following questions:
- Will Reliant Resources  permit Duquesne Light Company, the local distribution utility, to offer in its  service territory a competitive default service (CDS) program modeled after the  successful CDS program operating in the PECO Energy service territory? 
-  Will Reliant Resources exercise market power within local markets and should  particular plants be excluded from this acquisition to eliminate market power?  
- Will Reliant Resources commit to supporting economic demand-response  programs within PJM, instead of voting against demand response as it has done  recently?
- Will Reliant Resources acquisition help finance installation of  time-of-use meters for all customers with demand more than 50 kilowatts within  the Duquesne control area?
- What will Reliant Resources do to clean up some  of the heavily polluting plants that it owns now or will acquire from Orion?  
Reliant owns portions of Keystone and Conemaugh and Shawville power  plants. It would buy from Orion the Cheswick unit. Keystone and Cheswick have no  scrubbers installed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, while Shawville has been  scrubbing one out of four boilers. In 2000, Keystone, Shawville and Cheswick  respectively released 153,490 tons, 48,243 tons, and 44,908 tons of SOx into  Pennsylvania's air. Keystone is also the biggest emitter of mercury in the  entire country and all four plants spew huge amounts of nitrogen oxide - at a  rate more than double the modern standard of .15 lbs/mmbtu. That's not all - all  four plants produce an amazing 30 million tons of carbon dioxide, helping  Pennsylvania to contribute 1 percent of the entire world's human-induced global  warming gases.
Reliant can begin cleaning up by implementing in the  Duquesne area the equivalent of the PECO Service Territory's CDS program, which  includes a Renewable Portfolio Standard that increases annually the amount of  renewable energy that must be supplied to customers. CDS customers there are  served by New Power and Green Mountain Energy at 5.56 cents per kilowatt-hour  (kWh), more than three cents less than the 8.65 cents per kWh PECO Energy  charged its residential customers in 1996 for coal and nuclear power.  
Market Power Issues
In addition to environmental  issues, market power issues must be examined. Such an inquiry hinges on defining  the relevant market and products. 
Nationally, total generation capacity  is approximately 800,000 MW, with most of it subject to base rate regulation in  the retail market. Despite regulation at retail, wholesale generation  transactions are generally price deregulated in all 50 states, whether or not  the entities engaged in the transactions are deregulated generation owners,  regulated public utilities, municipal utilities, or electric cooperatives and  whether or not necessary market institutions required for workably competitive  markets exist. 
Orion Power has been participating in the deregulated  wholesale market. It owns 81 power plants in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and  West Virginia, producing approximately 6,000 MW and has another 5,000 MW under  construction. Orion has done an exceptional job, improving the forced outage  rates, especially among its New York City resources.
The proposed  acquisition of Orion Power by Reliant Resources will form the nation's second  largest deregulated power generation owner, controlling 17,279 MW, or 6.15  percent of the deregulated generation market that totals 281,000 MW of the  country's total capacity. Reliant Resources has a smaller share of the nation's  total generation capacity. 
Yet these small national shares do not  guarantee that Reliant Resources could not have market power in portions of the  PJM Market. 
Prior to this proposed acquisition, Reliant Resources owned  about 7 percent of total PJM generation, or 4,262 MW of generation capacity  within the 58,000-MW PJM market. These facilities include 2,009 MW of base load,  803 MW of intermediate load, and 1,450 MW of peaking capacity. They are quite  old and formerly owned by GPU and Sithe (see table in attached document).  Reliant Resources is also developing another 1,316 MW within PJM. 
These  numbers would indicate that regulators should focus on possible market power  within the Duquesne Control Area of the units that Reliant Energy is purchasing  from Orion. The Duquesne Control area is scheduled to become part of PJM West in  2002, but regulators and the Office of Consumer Advocate should ensure that no  plant is strategically located within the transmission system so that it  possesses market power even after incorporation of the control area within PJM  West. If any plants that would give Reliant Resources market power are  identified, they should be removed from this acquisition.   
Addressing Market Power
The combination of large  generation owners creates concerns over market power that can only be identified  and addressed by sound regulatory action. In all three of the Northeastern ISOs,  there have been incidents of market power which have resulted in numerous rule  changes. There are several reasons that the electric industry is sensitive to  market power. First is the inability to store energy. In many other industries  surpluses can be built up in low demand periods and used to fill in gaps during  high demand periods. In the electric industry, energy is produced and consumed  virtually instantaneously. Second, there are barriers to entry in the electric  industry, including discriminatory interconnection practices and other incumbent  advantages. Third, historically the demand for electricity has been inelastic  and creates the opportunity for inflated prices. Inelastic electricity demand is  not surprising when most customers see average prices and do not have metering  or the ability to respond to prices.
For these reasons, concrete steps to  combat market power in the electric industry must be taken. For starters, the  existing market mitigation measures, such as PJM's $1,000 price cap, should be  examined to determine if they are sufficient, while not being burdensome as to  limit new generation resources from entering the market. 
Secondly,  barriers to entry should be reduced, especially for distributed generation and  environmentally beneficial grid technologies like wind energy. 
Lastly  and most importantly, demand-response programs can and must be developed.  California has shown that energy efficiency can preserve reliability and break  the market power of generation owners. Changing the demand for electricity is  the biggest and best protection against market power. 
A Deeply  Troubling Tale
Unfortunately, Reliant Resources did not support  PJM's Economic Demand Response programs, voting against them last year in the  Members Committee. It had company, with all generation owners voting as a block,  with one exception, against demand response. Three cheers for the exception:  Edison Mission. 
In the face of the mass opposition of generation owners,  PJM wobbled but did not cave. It changed but submitted demand-response programs  to FERC which were approved for the summer of 2001. 
The moral of this  tale is that the public interest needs regulators, the PJM Board, and other  interested parties to further demand-response initiatives, because generation  owners will likely be roadblocks. In particular, real-time metering, residential  air conditioning and heating programs, and wholesale markets all need to be  developed. 
It is time for strong action on these points. Regulators must  begin by requiring Reliant Resources to finance the installation of time-of-use  meters for all customers with demand of 50 kW or more within the Duquesne  control area. This is especially important as the transition there may be  completed by 2004.

Evan,

Attached is a matrix that identifies our current State Licenses.  We work directly with EES Legal for license renewals and new registrations.  As Craig has indicated below, our records indicate we are current for both Licensing and Bond Requirements in Illinois at a State Level.

As EES is currently pursuing Supplier Billing Option (SBO) behind Commonwealth Edison, we will have to comply with the credit worthiness requirements outlined by Gloria, but my understanding of her email indicates we currently meet these standards and will only be required to supply funds in the event our credit rating drops further.

Please feel free to contact either of us with questions.

Evan,

As you know, the license application function was migrated to the Service Desk in August 2001.  This activity was previously maintained by Beth Gooden.  In any case, our records show that EES is current and compliant.  EES was granted a retail license in August 1999.  To maintain the license, EES must submit an annual "Re-certification" and keep a bond current.  A Re-certification application was submitted on 1/31/01 and the  bond was extended through 6/1/02.

I hope this answers your concerns.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.



Craig

Janine:

Below is a short response I have drafted if we choose to respond (although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary) to these emails.  I'm a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails.  I think our best response to Ron (Cinergy) is that MISO does not serve load, so MISO is not accountable to IURC.  Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility?  If we agree with that statement, are they subject to any IURC oversight?  Even if they are, I don't think it should be because of the "bundled" retail load issue, but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all "public utilities" (perhaps for safety reasons?) within its state.  But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility, then we may need to revise the statement below.

I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any "bundled retail load" in Indiana once MISO is operating.  In a prior order, FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff.  If this is the case, one could argue that the service is no longer "bundled" but I don't think we want to get into that argument with these guys.  

Here is some language that I put together.  What does everyone else think?


The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region.  MISO will not serve retail load, nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers.  Therefore, we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC.  

Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers.  They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers.  It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC, not MISO.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a "public interest" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and "load up" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific "Christmas tree ornaments."

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a "rubber stamp" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not

approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity Recall
      NOPR
?			Comments due November 19th
?	Conference Call November 14th
?
As discussed on the last Gas Issues Working Group conference call, attached are draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  EPSA opposes the NOPR because it (a) will reduce competition in the secondary market for transportation services and (b) may reduce the pipeline operational flexibility needed by electric generators.   Thus, EPSA urges the Commission not to impose a broad based recall requirement throughout the natural gas industry but rather gain experience with this difficult issue in individual Order No. 637 proceedings.

Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin@epsa.org by noon on Thursday, November 15th so that we can make a timely filing by Monday, November 19th.  EPSA will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 1:00 P.M. (EST) to discuss the draft.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Jack Cashin/EPSA Call.

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a "public interest" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and "load up" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific "Christmas tree ornaments."

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a "rubber stamp" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Subject: Alliance - NG Next Steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of thoughts --

1.	NG is trying to schedule a meeting in Columbus either Dec 4 or Dec 5.

2.	I did speak with Ashley.  He indicated that NG has no specific inclination to avoid LMP in the real-time.  He did not, however, confirm that NG was indifferent.

3.	I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his point #1.  NG may simply have misstated its intentions.  But clearly this position makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I (they would be giving up too much).

4.	I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownership of some (but not necessarily all) transmission plant in its footprint.

5.	Let's try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the London office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market.

Luiz -  Can you please develop some questions / talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meeting?

Thanks

Subject:	RE: Alliance

Just been through the paper and have the following thoughts or concerns depending on your viewpoint:

1.  The model is inconsistent with the approach taken by FERC.  NG propose that every transco. sets its own rates, runs its own OASIS and manages congestion....how can this ensure 'seamless practices' within each RTO footprint?  I suggest the opposite will occur, that is balkanization.  For example, Transco's can join MISO under Appendix I, and a number are proposing to do so.  Based on NG's proposed split of functions each transco. could join MISO with its own tx rates, OASIS platform and congestion protocol regardless of whether they are consistent.  Under this scenario transmission rates and markets would remain balkanized and vary depending on transmission company geographic reach (similar to today).
2.  NG state that the benefit of a 'for profit' entity is that it can and will manage risk commercially, i agree!  However NG miss the point here....If an RTO/ISO is a non profit organisation, it will only provide services such as tariff admin., OASIS and congestion management (such an RTO will not own tx. assets...the tx. companies that it provides services on behalf of will continue to do so!).  In providing these services the RTO/ISO only manages risk associated with non provision of service, not the underlying transmission delivery risk.  The transmission companies, for whom the RTO provides services, will continue to be 'for profit entities' and will continue to manage risks commercially (RTO benefits result primarily from aggregation of services not from more appropriate commercial risk management...there is nothing to stop tx. owners from managing risk more effectively regardless of proposed RTO structure.  For example NG as a transco., Translink or Cinergy transmission could propose liquidated damage clauses for overselling firm transmission under the non profit RTO structure.  Likewise NG as transco and RTO could make the same proposal).  Commercial form is a second order issue!
3.  NG should have concentrated on supporting FERC policy (4 RTO's) rather than stating one parties view on separation of RTO functions between profit/non profit entities.  FERC policy suggests that the key structural issues are; increasing market size (4 regional markets) and third party access ('level playing field').  This was the basis for the CGM proposal that came out of the SE mediation.  Separating CM and OATT admin. from planning and security coord. improves third party access to real time information which in turn will facilitate market based investment decision making (being investment in transmission, generation or DSM).  Suggesting that transmission investment is necessary to resolve existing transmission constraints either shows ignorance or more likely the conflict that NG has...i suggest that investment in generation or DSM could resolve the problems just as adequately.
4.  The model seems to be based on the assumption that transmission charges will continue to be based on 'contract path' (congestion managed through redispatch).  I assume that NG, and other transmission companies, prefer this approach as it allows them to both maximise cash returns (above appropriate regulated rates) and control information that facilitates new investment (retain monopoly).  I agree with Jim that this suggests a physical approach to congestion management.  NG's concept that third parties can 'energy markets' is consistent with the ARTO approach (i.e. allowing an APX to provide day ahead market functions for example).  I would propose that a transco. should not care what tx. charging methodology was in place as long as it is perceived to be reasonable by customers and receives its aggregate regulated revenue requirement.  Thus CM and OATT administration are not core transco. functions at all...

In summary, I suggest that NG actually propose the paper to reflect a 'for profit' RTO but they do not state this anywhere (even if true, they do not state anywhere that a transco. should have consistent OATT and CM protocols if the assets they own are non contiguous or the transco. has a number of owners). I agree with Luiz that in this form it is a hard sell and does not resolve Enron's ongoing concerns...

regards
Mike

Jim

As per your request, I examined the attached doc (Response of National Grid US to Questions posed by the  Com << File: National Grid Transco White Paper.doc >> m ission)

My initial reaction is:

1) The simple answer to your question is: yes, I think the proposed governance and organization structure can live with an LMP model. I am not familiar with other MISO CM model, but at least in terms of LMP, my feeling is that those are not mutually exclusive. It may be worth asking Ashley Brown

2) National Grid and other proponents of For-Profit-Transcos may have other ideas on how to manage congestions (e.g. different reliability level products by customer segment). However, the attached paper makes no allusion to avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models. The paper does not imply a physical model either. Your feeling may be right, but it does not surface from the paper per se.

3) National Grid proposal is, in fact, an expanded version of the Southeast Model proposed at the Mediation. It reinforces the role of the Transco Company, preempting, to some extent, the role of the System Admininstrator. This was a very controversial topic in the mediation: the System Adminstrator was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias.  (particularly from transmission companies who are not willing/able to transfer their T assets)

4) National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea; Your concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are "surfaced" in the paper, by creating a concept of "core vs. additional" functions and a chinese wall, if necessary.  But the perception of potential bias does exist. National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in " selling"  this idea. Particularly when we get to the details

NG proposal for "splitting" work between Transco and other parties.  Don't think they do a great job of managing the key fears - (1) generation redispatch and (2) long-term transmission plant over generation investments.  

As I read this document, I get the strange feeling that NG is a physical-right player.  Meaning, NG needs to build a model based on physical flows so they can control (a) TTC/ATC and (b) use of non-firm transmission.  

While the NG letter states that the "functions related to energy markets can be performed by a disinterested third-party", NG specifically reserves as a Core Function the "Ability to propose congestion pricing methodology".  Sure APX could go in and operate the balancing and CM system, but NG has the right to design subject to FERC procedures.

Not sure what you guys think?  

I will probably get back to Ashley Brown later this week.

Thank you for your note.  You did not offended me in any way that I am aware.

Frankly, Jim and I were discussing the appropriate routing of information to the EES Senior Management Team.  I believe that in any situation other than health or safety issues we have an obligation to factor in all constituents (ie. Rebecca Fite in this situation) and gain the facts before issuing statements about a topic that includes the President of our company in the distribution. 

I do value and appreciate your contributions on the ConEd efforts that preceded your e-mail regarding the Illinois Certification.  Unfortunately, your e-mail (that contained a key inaccuracy) caused several additional e-mails to be circulated and caused a bit of confusion.  In the future -- I agree wtih you and would like to avoid as much confusion as possible.

If you think it best -- I would welcome a meeting between Jim and you and Rebecca and me to better understand how to work together.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Evan,
I was standing beside Jim Steffes last thursday, when you gave him your "editorial" of me. In the 2 weeks that I worked with you on ConEd, I did not realise that I offended you in any way, personally or professionally. I have also had similar negative feedback from Jason Woodward, and I have never met or worked with him. 
Before your group assumed the new market role for EES, I worked very closely with Peter Vint, Robert Gresch, Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues. 
We worked as a team, and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up, we all pitched in to resolve the issues. Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues, and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking. I have tried to respect that.

Prior to sending out the IL analysis, I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis, and had some questions. I did not get a call back. Taking the time to return that call, may have saved us all some uneccessary stress. Well, good things do sometimes come from bad situations. The good thing is that we have all seen the need for a closer approach to new market entry issues. I intend to work with your group to develop a mutually acceptable level of interaction and interface.

Thanks,
Gloria

Gloria,
This is to confirm Con Edison's receipt of Enron Energy Services' wire for
billing agency security in the amount of $1 million.  Enron Energy Services'
cash deposit is subject to the NYS PSC approved interest rate for "other
customer capital".  Please note that interest will be paid on an annual
basis, and that the "other customer capital" interest rate changes each
calendar year.

Based on Enron Energy Services' successful completion of Con Edison's
billing agency test using hard copy bills, and our receipt of the signed
billing agency agreement and security deposit in the amount of $1 million,
Enron Energy Services may now begin enrolling new accounts with billing
agency status.  We will immediately code Enron Energy Services' existing
customer account population with billing agency status, as well.  As
previously agreed, Con Edison will express mail the bills produced each day
for Enron Energy Services' customer account population using Enron Energy
Services' Airborne Express account number to the address shown below:
	CSC BILLING DEPT
	700 MILAM NORTH TOWER 6FL
	HOUSTON, Texas  77002

Lastly, any future changes to Enron Energy Services' security coverage
amount or type will be done in strict accordance with the standards set
forth in the Uniform Business Practices.

If you have any other questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

Guys --

I understand the differences.  Becky is going to get on the EPSA call tomorrow and tell them that we are ok with the NOPR (and will file as such) and that EPSA should make sure to not blow up the NOPR (or try).  Becky if EPSA wants complete agreement, then they shouldn't file.  Grab me if you want to talk.

Jim -- Leslie responded that ENA's comments are in favor of the NOPR, as long as the shipper and released-to-customer agree on the terms and subject to legitimate pipeline operational (accounting/balancing) concerns (which accommodate the pipelines' concerns).  Therefore, ENA is taking a different position than EPSA.  Furthermore, EPSA's comments include Dynegy comments against the NOPR.

I agree with ENA's position.  Is this something that EPSA would want agreement of all members to file?  Also, it seems that ENA's approach is consistent with being allowed to make something you purchased into a product that your customer wants.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
      Gas Issues Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
           John Orr, Gas Issues Working Group Chair
           Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
           Jack Cashin, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE: 11/9/2001

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity Recall    
      NOPR 
?			Comments due November 19th
?	Conference Call November 14th
?	
As discussed on the last Gas Issues Working Group conference call, attached are draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  EPSA opposes the NOPR because it (a) will reduce competition in the secondary market for transportation services and (b) may reduce the pipeline operational flexibility needed by electric generators.   Thus, EPSA urges the Commission not to impose a broad based recall requirement throughout the natural gas industry but rather gain experience with this difficult issue in individual Order No. 637 proceedings. 

Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin@epsa.org by noon on Thursday, November 15th so that we can make a timely filing by Monday, November 19th.  EPSA will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 1:00 P.M. (EST) to discuss the draft.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Jack Cashin/EPSA Call.

Tom et al--you guys could do color commentary! And yes, your visit to Pennsylvania was obviously presuasive. Thanks for the update.  

Rick/Jim/Sue--one of the things we need to talk about in a general context is how we are going to address the Enron swipes in these types of forums.  I imagine they are going to continue for many months to come and my initial thought is to make sure that we have Enron people at as many forums and conferences as there are out there and not shy away from public visibility. I'm not sure how I feel about whether we should be trying to get spots on the panels and whether if we do that, it should be a high level person like a Rick or a Jim.  A strategic discussion on this issue in the near term would be appreciated.

Subject:	NARUC Day 1

Monday's NARUC convention consisted of three sessions, 1)opening remarks; 2) FERC RTO Policy Update; and 3) a session on attracting capital to the energy infrastructure. 

1)	Opening Remarks - The convention opened with remarks by NARUC President William Nugent, FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell, PA PUC Chairman Glenn Thomas (substituting for former Governor Ridge), and the featured speaker Comcast Cable President Brian Roberts.  
a.	Nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didn't much of anything.
b.	Brownell introduced a Georgia Commissioner named Bubba who sang several patriotic songs (she did not address anything relative to FERC policy or activity)
c.	Thomas spoke about the great state of PA, Benjamin Franklin, William Penn, and Philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy
d.	Roberts talked about the future of cable television.
2)	The FERC Policy Update - this panel consisted of moderator Nugent, FERC Staff Dan Larcamp, Southern Company Chairman Allen Franklin, James Torgenson of DPL, and PA Commissioner Terence Fitzpatrick.  
a.	Larcamp and did not provide very much information or in-site into FERC RTO policy.  He did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the RTO's (what he didn't say was that they would be the same rules and protocols).  He said that they are looking at 3 RTO's at least,  In the Midwest the Alliance is moving forward and MISO is getting bigger with the addition of SPP and that FERC is looking at if the Midwest RTO should be 1 or 2 RTO's; in the Northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered (I took this to mean that on governance they are going to go three/three/three from each ISO, but others I talked with outside the session didn't get that - time will tell); and the Southeast will be slower to develop, there are small but clear regional differences that are important, and that it must accommodate the for-profits and the not-for-profits (public power).
b.	Franklin from Southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for RTO's (interesting comment) and there are two major issues to be considered in forming RTO's - cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted.  He promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates (he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north, but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate).  He promoted the SETRANS model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south.
c.	Torgenson of DPL gave a very dry overview of the status of MISO with nothing new to report.
d.	Fitzpatrick of PA (one of the Commissioners Steffes, Montovano, and I met with in July) began by stating the PA Commission is fully supportive of the NERTO (must have been our July meeting) for two reasons i) advantages of a bigger market, and ii) FERC's clear preference for PJM as the platform.  He mentioned the concern of commissions in other PJM states but, in general there is support.  He then went on to stress the merits of DSM.
3)	The last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an Enron perspective (we have quickly  become the fodder for case studies and Enron is now a verb that is more akin to a four-letter verb.  The panel consisted of moderator Iowa Commissioner Diane Munns, Charles Cicchetti of Pacific Economic Group, Jeff Miller of J.P. Morgan Partners, Christine Uspenski of Schwab Capital Markets, and Walter Rogers of Merrill Lynch Asset Management.
a.	Cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators' job harder and that they must be market participants (he used the term GONZO market participants).  He also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the RTO's, no one will build transmission (no reason given) and that regulators need to be involved.
b.	Rogers' (of Merrill Lynch) most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions - California, the downturn in the economy, and ENRON.
c.	Uspenski from Schwab told the regulators "Don't get Enron'd".  That if something presented to you doesn't seem to make sense then it doesn't and they should investigate further.
d.	Miller from JP Morgan also mentioned Enron several times in the same context as the others.

Signed,
Hoatson, Robinson, Staines, Connor

Working g Group Meeting
Importance: High


Attached is a work plan for a 3-RTO working group (known as SSG-WI) to develop a market monitoring plan for CAISO, RTO West, and WestConnect.  It is turning into the (western) United Nations of Market Monitoring.  According to the attached plan, "This work plan is structured to first agree on the MME's authority and responsibilities, and then focus on the best structure to effectuate the agreement.  "  

We need to quickly decide our level of participation.  Dave participated in a meeting last week and it got them to not send out biased meeting notes. To actually steer the BPA-CAISO train into something we live with, however, will take a lot of work.  I suggest that we bring this up on our next "Western" call.  That being said, I will be on a plane on Thurs morning.  (Ray, could we have the Thursday call at 8:30/10:30/11:30 PST/CDT/EST??)

Hi --

Here's the revised work plan that incorporates Steve's comments.  (I've added a meeting and moved forward some of our "resolution"
dates.  I've also inserted a meeting location rotation.)  I've attached both a red-line and clean version of the work plan.

I think this is ready to go, although everyone might want to take one last look (especially as it sets out an aggressive schedule).
Steve, I assume you'll take care of forwarding the meeting notes and the work plan to SSG-WI.  Let me know if there is anything else
I can do to help.

Thanks!  Kristi

GPU Energy has requested that EES provide an updated Third Party Supplier agreement as approved by the NJ Board of Public Utilities.
EES currently has financial customers behind GPU. Physical delivery is not projected to commence until 2003. I and Will 
Frederking have reviewed the TPS Agreement and identified some issues that will require the attention and sign-off of the
business units. Relevant business issues include:
1. Credit worthiness standards - EES to provide security equal to 60 days of customer summer usage
2. Taxes - EES to collect and remit all taxes related to electricity sales 
3. Limitation of Liability - EES must insure that any T & D failure including disconnections, curtailment, interruption or reduction of service, is a force majeure event in our contracts, 
4. Billing  - EES is precluded from raising billing disputes, 20 days after the invoice due date 
5. Assignment - GPU consent is required before any assignment by EES
The attached memo sets out these and other issues in more detail. Please note that EES has a similar agreement with Public Service Electric
& Gas Company of New Jersey. Because these agreements are filed with the BPU, and apply to all NJ utilities, GPU resists any attempt 
to propose amendments. Please review and advise by noon tomorrow if you'll approve executing the document as is.

The only way to collect the "overpayment" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.

I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.  If PG&E reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect FERC-ordered refunds, I do not understand why it would affect already-issued CTC charges.  The cost of power would be cheaper going forward.

Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable "HC" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its "Est RT$".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the "HC" or  "Est RT$"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E).  I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?  

On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.

After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no?  So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. 

If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.  This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC.

RE: EPSA Second Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity
      Recall  NOPR
?			Comments due November 19th
?
As discussed on Wednesday's Conference Call attached are second draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  This draft reflects the changes suggested during the conference call. The following are the major changes from the earlier draft:

1. The word "Opposing" has been removed from the filing.  Rather the filing retains the same arguments but indicates that EPSA has "concerns".

2. We added footnote 1 to stress that in no event should the Commission mandate that such recall provisions be included in a recall notice.  Rather consistent with the NOPR, such recalls should only be permitted, with the ultimate determination being subject to negotiation between the releasing and replacement shipper.

3. We added footnote 3 to recognize that this filing reflects the views of EPSA as an organization, not the views of individual members.

4. We added the footnotes missing from the earlier draft.

5. We did some minor editing to page 3, the first full paragraph.  The sentence starting with "This service will be of less value to potential purchasers than any firm service the pipeline could offer...." and well as the next sentence are slightly different than the earlier draft.

Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin@epsa.org by close of business on Friday, November 16th so that we can make a timely filing on Monday, November 19th.

2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale"
3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs
4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.

Subject: RE: Draft Comments on Marketing Affiliate NOPR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are my thoughts --

1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.
2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.
3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).
4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption.
5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.
6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.
7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.

I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?

Jim

Subject:	EPSA Paper on Market Based Rates

I sat in on the EPSA call on market based rates on Friday.  As you know, the Commission has on its agenda for tomorrow a new proceeding entitled "Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations" (presumably being done under the Commission's section 206 authorization).  EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates.  The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists.

I have a call in to EPSA to see if I can get any more details about what the press release will say.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for the press release.   I'll let everyone know what comes out of the FERC meeting as soon as I find out.

EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

Subject:	RE: Rock Tenn CoGen Facility

Bob,

Per Section 25.345 (c) of the Electric rules, if the Cogen facility has a rated capacity of 10MW or less, it qualifies as "eligible generation" under Section 25.345(c)(B). In Section 25.345(i), an end-user whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a T & D utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges.  

Also a retail customer whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation who also receives electrical service that require the delivery of power through the facilities of a T & D utility, shall be responsible for payment of stranded costs charges based solely on the services that are actually provided by the T & D utility.

The short answers to your questions are:
1. Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any T&D services from TXU.
2. If Rock Tenn uses T&D facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T& D utility. 
3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities T&D services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC.
4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved $363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Gloria,

Per the information you provided Trish (below) concerning CTC in TX, the cogen design is less than 10MW. Therefore, what are the "DG rules" and how do these rules impact Rock Tenn's requirement to pay CTC? What if they only use the utility's T&D facilities occasionally when the cogen is not running? What if they completely disconnect from the utility's T&D facilities, as if they are no longer in business? Is TXU expected to have significant stranded costs?

Thanks, Bob

Trish,

Per Chapter 39.252(b)(1) of the Texas Utilities Code, recovery of stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers within the utility's certificated territory as it existed on May 1, 1999. A retail customer may not avoid CTC's by switching to a new on-site generation. New on-site generation is defined as an electric generator generating more than 10 MW, capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of the utility T & D facilities, and which was not fully operational prior to 12/31/99. (If the self-gen facility's output is 10 MW or less, it will be governed by the DG  rules.)

If a customer commences taking energy from a new on-site generation (with output of more than10 MW ) which materially reduces or eliminates the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the CTC which is in effect during the month.

Any CTC assessed on such a self -gen facility after it becomes fully operational, shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with services actually provided by the T & D utility to the customer after the facility has become fully operational. So if no services actually provided, there should be no payment.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Gloria, Jim and Harry;

Thanks for pulling us all together on Monday. We look forward to working with your group on merging the State Licensing and Utility Agreements into a common area, in order to keep the organization informed and up to date.

I wanted to re-cap just a bit.  The Services Group has state licensing responsibility for Gas and Power for EESI and EEMC. We handle new licensing and renewals.  We are on an "auto-reminder" distribution from EES legal, Heather Mathis for renewals/reporting.  We physically house all documentation relating to licensing on our floor. We currently publish and distribute as needed State License status report which identifies where we are licensed and what our license # is.  The Services Group works directly with Gloria for utility agreements, as we are one of many groups who she obtains sign-off from and/or information in order to execute agreements and State Licensing information is critical to her processes.

Gloria and I met yesterday to discuss next steps.  We are working together to provide the following.

1) Matrix of Executed Agreements which includes: State, License #, UDC, Agreement Type, Signatory, Date Issued, Expiration/Renewal, Security Requirements. (2 Weeks)
2) Backfill each groups need for documentation - provide copies of State Licenses and/or UDC agreements. (2 Weeks)
3) Identify the EES/ENE contacts sent to the State/UDC, update as needed, internally and externally. (2 - 3 Weeks)
4) Provide Summary information regarding State/UDC that can be placed on EES Market Central (2-3 Weeks?)
5) Ensure information is updated, published, organized and accessible to all interested parties. - Gloria has initiated creating binders that will be housed on the 47th floor - we will encompass State information with the executed UDC agreements. 

Gloria, please feel free to add anything I have overlooked.  I've attached the contact list currently used when obtaining State Licenses. This should help identify other stakeholders who you may want to speak with.

 

Regards,
Rebecca

Update on the MD EEMC license issue - 

We talked to both Accounting and Resource Planning Staff at the MD Commission and they indicate the remaining outstanding item is a request for an unlimited, unconditional, unrestricted parental guarantee.  Suppliers have been unwilling to provide such a guarantee.  The Commission has been approving these requests for licenses on a 90 day, provisional basis, pending a later determination of how or if they will modify the parental guarantee requirement. 

We will go forward with trying to get this provisional approval tomorrow and then address the guarantee requirements as they become known.

See attached.  Crazy Commissioner (Carl Wood) at the PUC is now trying to require folks to submit their DA contracts to the PUC (everyone refused the first time he "asked").  Customers are going to get very cranky about this.  Likely to be a pretty pitched battle.  I'm contacting the large customers to see what they intend to do.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Thanks.

Subject:	Performance / Surety Bonds

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

I have read the MISO filing and have the same concerns you have with respect
to the granularity of the source.  I have passed the filing onto others in

Subject: DOE Meeting Dec 7th



Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the merger, transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners (IP / PGE) should not do business with the other.  
 
If EES or EPMI is buying or selling from IP, please let me know.  Also, if we are delivering to retail load behind the IP market, we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct.  I don't think that we have to worry much with PGE side because EPMI and EES are already acting within the code of conduct.

Subject: Enron Questions on NG - ARTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ashley --

First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.  

Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.  If you have any questions, please call me.

Also, Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.

Thanks,

Jim

=============================

1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV?

 

2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive 
consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?

3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other
negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?

4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?

5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?

6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?

7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model] 

8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?

9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?

10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?

11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?

12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?

13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models

EES received a margin call for $4.3MM on Nov 19th from Niagara Mohawk for EES gas business to cover settlement and imbalance risk for NIMO's "Supplier Select" Program.  The Enron Corp. gaurantee is no longer acceptable at our current rating.  Legal has confirmed NIMO's rights under its gas tariff.

One more.

- Washington Gas: EES has parental guaranty. Due to current financial status, Washington Gas has requested Bond instead. RAC contact indicated no bond available - EES has 30 days to respond.

A note on the Con-Ed - Services/Operations has a work around for the few Mid-market deals origination is closing which will prevent us from increasing our security (Straight Dual Billing). Mass Market volume increase will drive any security increase in this market.

Rebecca

... and just to be clear, here are the recent or current issues I am aware of and their status:

Con Ed, request for $1 million security in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  $1 million sent prior to 11/14 deadline.  Request for additional security likely to come when Con Ed sees our increasing load.
SoCal Gas, request for margin sharing agreement in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  New contract signed and delivered 11/16.  Retail and wholesale gas desks to work together to avoid occurence of margin call for credit over $5 million daily.
Peoples Gas of IL, request for letter of credit for $40k in lieu of parental guaranty:  deferred.  Peoples agreed to suspend demand for l/c if further downgrade does not occur.
Virginia license for EES gas:  complete, for now.  Services served copy of application to other parties.  Their comments due back to VA SCC by Dec 7.
Maryland license for EEMC gas:  scheduled to be approved on provisional basis today.  MD PSC will be reviewing generic requirement that parental guarantees be unconditional, unlimited, and unrestricted.
Pennsylvania, request for update to EES and EPMI bonds and request for increase in EES bond from $250k to $3.8m:  Under review.  New bond language has been sent to Mary Grisaffi.  Trying to whittle down (or eliminate) increase.
CG&E, request for deposit associated with Transmission Service Agreement:  being processed.  Service request reduced from 100 MW to 25 MW to reduce cash outlay.
First Energy, requested new security in lieu of parental guaranty.  deferred.  First Energy agreed to continue accepting parental guaranty in absence of further downgrade.

If there are others we should know about, please let me know.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Thanks.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Subject:	DOE Meeting Dec 7th

Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

Subject: RE: RTO Comments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My thoughts --

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

Thanks.

Attached are draft RTO comments.  The comments reflect EPMI's views on RTO development, given the Commission's apparent recent changes in position on the number of RTOs to be created.  We urge Right Sized RTOs without choosing a number.  


The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please "Reply to All" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help.

Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments

Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the "LMP in the West" argument is correct before you show him the comments.

Subject: RE: Pac Tel - CPUC Customer Switch Complaint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Geoff for following up.  
 
I do have a few questions before getting back to my contact at the CPUC.
 
1.You said that we "inadvertently" DASRd this account.  Not sure if this is viewed as a slam.  Did PacTel give EES the account number?  Why shouldn't this account be on our switch list?  Does he have the right to override "headquarters"?  Before we de-DASR the account, let's make sure that he has the authority to say "no".
 
2.If SBC gave us the wrong account number, how do we know that there are not more wrong account numbers?  Can we ask PacTel to confirm that all accounts are authorized to be switched?
 
I don't think this is a big problem, but in the earlier situation with UC/CSU, the "local" customer was wrong - he did not have the authority to override central.  I just want to make sure.  Also, do we have evidence that the switch request for this account came from PacTel?  I may need this when I call the CPUC.

All, 
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.

I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation. 
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.
