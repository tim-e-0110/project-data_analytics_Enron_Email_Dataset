This is the primebroker agreement that we need to fill out for CSFB.  They are holding two trades hostage so this is a priority for us.  Please let me know if you require any further information.

Texon Energy Corporation located in Stamford, CT appears to have no relation to Texon Corporation and/or its successor Texon L.P. which are both located here in Houston.  We have traded liquids in the past with Texon Corporation and Texon L.P. ; primarily crude oil.

Hi Marie,

The fee letter looks good - and I have all of the paperwork here, except of
course the Termination letter for ENA Deal #0619, which you indicated the
Confirmation Desk was workin on.  So things look good to go.

I have the paperwork back from both Dynegy and Sempra, but United Oil's
letters is being reviewed by its lawyer today.  He was away for the past two
days.  As soon as I have everything together I will courier the complete
package to you - one detail that I forgot to mention - right now I have fax
copies only, and I hope it will suffice until I can get original signatures.
If it does not, then we are in real trouble!!  So say it is okay - and I
will work on the originals after the deal is completed.

Thanks for all your help, Marie.

Hi, Roeline:

We would prefer to sign the fee letter at the same time we sign the assignments.  Yes, we will sign enough originals of all documents so that all parties can have an original.

Hopefully we can get this wrapped up tomorrow, as I will be out of the office Friday.

Marie -

One more question - I received some of these in duplicate, and some of them
were original only.  Like the Termination Agreement that you just couriered
over to me - I only got one original from you, and there are two signatures.
We would like to have an original signature as well - so are we going to do
this after the fact?  That would be okay by me, because I want to have them
all signed and off my desk - so just let me know how you think we should do
this.

Thanks, Marie -

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Do we have to wait for Board resolutions (December BOD mtg) to have Rick start signing, or can they be retroactive ie. ratifying what he's signed if he starts immediately.  I'd think we could do the latter, as that's what you had to do for me.

Here is a list of inner company counterparties that require ISDA Master Agreements.

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the
referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign
the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc.
signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such
agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.
Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of
ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear
Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the
corporate documentation?

Ms. Lemont:

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the
referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign
the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc.
signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such
agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.
Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of
ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear
Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the
corporate documentation?

Mary Perkins executed an amendment to the Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of Bear Stearns, et al on May 15, 2001.  The original guaranty guaranteed obligations of Enron Credit Inc. under a brokerage arrangement.  Bear Stearns has requested a certificate of incumbency with Mary's specimen signature.

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

Marie,

   What is the threshold for an eligible contract participant for an entity?  Is it $5MM?  I have a New Zealand counterparty who would like to delete the eligible contract participant rep. 

  All here is pretty spooky - we are just waiting for the hammer to drop!

   Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see
   attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced
   AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to
   masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading
   affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the
   AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc.
   ("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling
   agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas,
   physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit
   group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical
   synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  Please
   contact me with any questions. -- David

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry
picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express
language.

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis
of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading
forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition
of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day
limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be
included in any physical contract that will be included in a master
netting agreement, especially because of the current international
situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 <<MASTER NETTING & SECURITY AGMNT 10 H V1 RED.DOC>>
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms
with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate
document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 <<Master Netting User Notes.doc>>

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use
without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1
(to use with collateral annex).

Tanya:

Please see Tom Doukas's request below.  Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. et al dated March 29, 2001, with a $25,000,000 cap.  This guaranty secured obligations of Enron Credit, Inc. in connection with a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement.  The cap was increased to $100,000,000 by amendment dated May 15, 2001.  Are you okay with adding ECT Europe Finance, Inc. as an additional guaranteed party?

Thanks!

Marie

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Clement!

Attached is the Amendment to the Enron Corp. guaranty delivered to Dynegy last week.  The only change we made is to include a reference to the inclusion of master netting agreements in the second paragraph.

If the attached is acceptable, please have signed and call me when it's ready and I'll pickup.

Just today I became aware that the master netting agreement with Reliant involves Enron Canada as well.  Greg Johnston and I will see that the proper Canadian registrations are made for the Reliant agreement.

Please let me know if there are any other agreement that involve Canadian Enron entities (BP Amoco I believe may).

Be sure to talk to Peter on any of the Canada related master nettings so he
can orchestrate any necessary Canada filings.  I have spoken with him on

   We will need the "organizational ID" number for the Delaware, Maryland
   and
   Texas entities.  If you wish, we can obtain this information from CT
   Corp.
   or a similar service provider for a charge of $12 per entity.

   Also, for UCC filing purposes, we need to know whether any counterparty
   is
   a "transmitting utility", i.e., entity primarily engaged in transmitting
   or
   producing electricity or transmitting goods by pipeline.

   Finally, I assume you will consult with local counsel regarding the
   Canadian counterparties.

Bill does not want to include any of the brokerage agreeements.  Also, I beleive we have kept Metals out of everyhting thus far and should continue to do so.  One point of note in the document is section 2 BNPP appears to have modified the language such that the Non Defaulting party can cherry pick which agreements it wants to terminate - this is unacceptable. To be honest, I am going to need your help walking me through this document as they have changed so much I am unclear in many instances  what their changes accomplish.  Please advise.

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Hi, Athena:

The Williams counterparties are:  Williams Energy Marketing & Trading

The following entities have been added to our master netting agreement list

Producers Marketing Ltd.

Noble:
Noble Gas Marketing Inc.
Samedan Oil Corporation

Tractebel Energy Marketing, Inc.

My phone number is (713) 853-3907.

Hi, Edmund!

Can you help us?  We need to find a representative sample of a physical UK gas confirmation with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited and BNP Paribas.  Una said she can't locate anything.  We need this ASAP as we must get this master netting agreement finalized.

Thanks!

Hi, Edmund!

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Hi, Roeline:

No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.

We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be "business as usual" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving!

Hi Marie -

I have been trying to get the paperwork back from Sempra, however, Eric
Twombly keeps saying he thinks all assignment documents were returned to
Enron, including my copy.  I cannot get a confirmation that this is so
though.

So I thought I'd better check with you - please let me know whether you have
the Sempra assignment documents.  Also I wanted to send you the documents
signed by us, UOM and Dynegy - so as to get it off my desk.

Hope all is well with you - especially with what has happened in the past
two weeks.  Things sure do change in a hurry, don't they?

Regards,
Roeline

10.   At the beginning of Sections 7(c) and 7(e), insert the words "Subject
to Section 3,".

11.   In Section 15(b), following the words "on the basis of a payment
owed", insert the words "(including margin)".

12.   With respect to Section 17, our client has indicated that it would
not be useful or efficient to have the issue of arbitration (which is
clearly not central to the risk reducing purposes of the arrangements)
mixed up with the proposed agreement, which has arisen from the
circumstances of Enron that have developed over the last few months.  BNP
Paribas' primary reason for not wanting to include an arbitration clause
(even with the suggested language changes) is that, although the concept of
arbitration is being considered generally, BNP Paribas has, of yet, not
made any definitive decisions as to the implicit or necessary value of
arbitration clauses and such a decision would require significant internal
review and discussion.  Over the next few months, further consideration can
be given as to including arbitration in this agreement.

13.  Please note that BNP Paribas contemplates at least one long-form
confirmation as an Underlying Master Agreement.

Thank you for the drafts.  We are working on comments and hope to get you a redraft this week.

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Subject: BNP Paribas Master Netting Agreement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul, Matt and Edmund:

Attached is a copy of the Master Netting Agreement among BNP Paribas and Enron North America Corp., et al.  It is imperative that this master netting agreement be executed as soon as possible tomorrow morning (11/27), so I am asking your assistance in getting this document signed.  The UK entities to sign are EEFT, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited, Enron Credit Limited and Enron Metals Limited.  Please leave the signature pages as set forth on the attached document, as Enron Metals may be deleted from the agreement.  At this point, we aren't sure, so we will have it sign on a separate page and then if they are not a party to the agreement, we will omit their signature page.  

Please take whatever steps are necessary to have the attached document signed ASAP.  Harlan Murphy (713/345-2679 is the lawyer here in Houston who prepared the document.  Please contact either Harlan, Mary Cook (713/345-7732), Elizabeth Sager (713/853-6349) or Carol St. Clair (713/853-3989) if you have any questions.  Bill Bradford is the Credit contact and his number is (713) 853-3831.

When the document is signed, please fax the signature pages to me at (713) 646-3490.

MANY THANKS!!!!!!!

Unless by trading group they meant the actual traders--we're just the lawyers and staff.

I'll send you an e-mail tonight when I can talk--if you get my drift.

So since they said they wanted to keep their trading group intact, I would assume that means you should still have a place to go for the foreseeable future.

Tell them you need the job and make some of the big dog's give back some of their millions!
