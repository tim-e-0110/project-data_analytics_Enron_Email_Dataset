I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has 
been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the  
Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin 
McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at 
NSM Management Co. acted improperly. I wouldn't close your file yet.

Richard, Bonnie White advises me that you are handling this matter with 
outside counsel.  As you are aware, the underwriters denied coverage on this 
matter back in December 1999.  They have now inquired if any Amended 
Complaint has been filed that names a Director and/or Officer of Enron and if 
no Enron or an Enron subsidiary securities are involved.  If nothing has 
changed, they will go on and close their file.  Please advise if there is 
anything new to report.

Linda-

Attached is a schedule detailing the gain/loss calculation for Ice Drilling.  
Apparently PriceWaterhouseCoopers acted as a receiver and sold Ice Drilling 
in August 99.  We received total cash proceeds of $9,583,845.74 between 
August and September, but the value of the asset on the books was 
$9,979,591.85 (loss of $395,746.11).  We also wrote off a receivable of 
$474,557.83.  In summary, we lost a total of $870,303.94 ($395,746.11 + 
$474,557.83).  I am assuming that we are trying to recover the total amount 
lost of $870,303.94.  Let me know if you need further information.

Subject: Project Stanley - Blakes Account

		 Subject: Project Stanley - Blakes Account

Got your voice mail.  My thoughts are the following:

1.  I always insist that there is a breakdown of accounts by lawyer name, 
hourly rate and task description.  If it is not in this account I do not know 
why and I think it is appropriate that you ask for it and receive it.

2.  I would have expected the account to be large and that there are a number 
of people involved.  I lost involvement (at the direction of Delainey and 
Milnthorp) early in this project after the initial crisis management stage, 
but my observations of the number of people and resources involved are the 
following:  

At the outset we needed a number of people to manage the search and related 
technical and legal issues in the short term.  Over the longer term, staffing 
requirements ought to be greatly reduced and it seems that since the original 
crisis management stage the file has been over staffed.  At the same time, in 
fairness, I believe Blakes feels that the are responding to the requirements 
of Enron to throw al ot of resources at the project.  If it has not already 
happened, I believe you should speak to Dan Fournier to confirm our 
expectations and to discuss rationalizing resources.  As I say, I was asked 
to step back from this project, but I am happy to have this discussion with 
Dan Fournier if you prefer.

Also, I did not receive a copy of the account, but it seems to me that at our 
direction Blakes hired a number of economic and political consultants which 
will also be greatly expensive and which will as I understand be billed to 
Blakes and included in Blakes accounts as disbursements to maintain 
privilege.  If it has not already happened, I also believe the use of the 
consultants also needs to be rationalized.

I also expect that VE will have a not insignificant account.

In summary, since the initial stage I have had limited involvement, but I am 
not surprised (and would have expected) that the account is large and I 
expect that larger accounts are coming once consultant accounts start to roll 
in.  I believe that detailed account breakdowns are appropriate but also that 
the use of all consultants including Blakes needs to be rationalized.  I also 
believe that Blakes has done an excellent job and that a lot was be asked of 
them in the early stages and therefore they were throwing a lot of resources 
to the project.

Lastly, in anticipation that this would be expensive and that there would be 
a number of people involved, Rob Milnthorp initially spoke to John Lavorato 
about setting up a separate Houston RC for the project which John agreed to.  
The RC number I gave you may have been a Canadian RC and I need to confirm 
with accounting.  In any event, I will be sending a subsequent e-mail to all 
internal groups to make sure that all expenses, internal and external, are 
billed to that separate RC.

Peter.

Please let me know if I can be of any help.

include arbitration provisions.  We thought it might be useful to get your 
thoughts on our current forms to make sure we are consistent with up to date 
arbitration provisions.  Attached are three of our forms for your review.  
Please note that the Professional Services Agreement is a standard consulting

		 Subject: DOJ - Memo to File - Range of Market Values  



Pearson's June 9, 2000 letter questions why $.10 or $.11 were deducted from
the Transco and Koch indices in connection with the sale of Mobile Bay Block
870 gas.

We responded in detail on October 3.  In addition to those answers, we
should keep in mind that market value cannot necessarily be calculated with
mathematical precision.  Market value is often described in terms of a
range.  Indeed, the Inside FERC's Gas Market Reports publishes not only an
index price, but also a range of prices for each pipeline pricing point.

In looking at the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of the
sample months, it is clear that, if $.10 or $.11 were deducted from the
index price, then the resulting price would still be in the range as
published by Inside FERC.

For example, in December 1996, the Transco Zone 3 index price was $3.82.
The published range was $3.38 to $3.95.  So adjusting the index by 10 cents
still keeps you well within the range.

Similarly, for the 1996 Koch So. La. index.  The index price was $3.82.  The
range was $3.55 to $3.94.  Again, an 11 cent adjustment is still well within
the range.

A quick review of other months shows that sometimes the range was narrower,
and the adjustments would take you outside the range.  Nonetheless, we
should keep this background information in mind in case Justice continues to
pursue this point.

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
"misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards.

you don't want to give Richard any reason to transfer it to you (or to me).

John - I knew that this was tickling my memory and suddenly I remembered!  
Back in 1997 John Echols was appointed liquidator to continue the process of 
liquidating Enron Gas Liquids Europe S.A.R.L. (which I presume is the same 
entity to which you refer).  

By copy email I'm asking John Echols, Sue Kelly and Justin Boyd what happened 
to the liquidation proceedings.  Does the entity still exist and if not, how 
can we get copies of the liquidation evidence.

Hi, Kate. It surely can wait that long. 

By the wasy, we have another company that somehow has been allocated to us, 
Enron Gas Liquids, a French Company, that EECC was surprised to find it owns 
and has no use for, so we would like to liquidate it as well. Is that 
something your gang would handle as well, just to make sure that no other 
Enron entity needs it?

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of 
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron 
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate 
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such 
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse 
impact on Enron,s financial position or its results of operations.

 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris 
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company 
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company 
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners 
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have 
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two 
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matter, 
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and 
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the &Panhandle program,8 a 
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was 
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In 
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated 
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing 
to take the Plaintiffs, gas ratably with other producers, gas at certain 
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with 
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court 
ruled that the trial court,s class certification was improper and remanded 
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs, 
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute 
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and 
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no 
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these 
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or 
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal 
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, 
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San 
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a 
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service 
to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance 
carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, 
including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone 
Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their 
insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the 
District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits 
seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and 
property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years 
without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not 
to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or 
trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the 
explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The 
defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous 
suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal 
court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enron 
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a 
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric 
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power 
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion 
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) could 
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in 
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruling 
was the result of an appeal of PGE,s March 1995 general rate order which 
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment in 
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and was 
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and the 
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined 
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.  
On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that the 
OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return on 
its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC,s 
authorization of PGE,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme 
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for 
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the 
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE,s recovery of its 
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme 
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bill 
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciated 
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects 
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC,s authority to allow PGE,s 
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon 
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Court 
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC,s order allowing PGE to recover a 
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decision 
accepting the Utility Reform Project,s petition for review.  The Utility 
Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the 
proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of 
State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate the 
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has 
indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000 
elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionally, 
due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict, 
with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regarding 
PGE,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although no 
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these 
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or 
results of operations.

 Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and 
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require 
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the 
operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating 
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to 
result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses 
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron,s financial position or 
results of operations.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a 
potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant 
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, 
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah 
ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the 
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant and 
sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances 
were released to the environment during the period in which Enron,s 
predecessor owned the site, and that Enron,s predecessor assumed the 
liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these 
allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially 
responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of 
administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted 
subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly 
located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November 
1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999.  
Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA.  
Enron does not expect to incur any additional expenditures in connection with 
this site.

 Enron,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater 
remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur 
material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

Status Report re: tape transcripts

At this time, this summary has been sent to you only.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
exchange for our providing similar information to them.

He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, 
the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
equipment.

As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
the period of September of 1999 to the end of October.

The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover 
the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999.

With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim 
of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has 
asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.  
We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in 
time, they have not responded to us.

If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend 
to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this 
particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.

Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not 
particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
flavour of the matter to our benefit.

On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will 
advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see 
exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
Powerex and Enron.

We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.

Yt
Web Macdonald

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
Richard Sanders.

Enron Net Works currently supports the joint venture between Enron and Texaco 
called Bridgeline in the Three Allen Center Building.  My group supports the 
Trading telephony and recording equipment for this company.  My question is 
does this new audio retention policy cover this operating company or not

Subject: Retention Policy on Trading Tapes

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades

approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on

This is a follow-up to?the October 5 meeting on the AAA's  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? One of the most exciting aspects of  that meeting was 
the enthusiasm for the systems and services we are developing  to support the 
Protocol.? We are now at the stage in which we need to get  direct feedback 
from potential users, and I am putting together a working group  to look at 
several aspects of our efforts, including:
?
??? - The mechanics and timelines of the  services
??? - The qualifications of arbitrators and  mediators
??? - Integration and data transfer  issues
??? - Dispute tracking events
??? - Incorporating adjunct services to  offer?a complete dispute management 
process
?
At the meeting you expressed interest and?support for  our?proposed 
services?and how they might benefit Enron.? Enron's  involvement?in 
developing and refining our services would be invaluable to  us, and if?there 
is someone at Enron who could  participate in our efforts, please let me 
know.? Alternatively, you can  simply forward this message to them?and they 
could get in touch with  me.
?
Should you have any questions, you can reach me by e-mail

Attached is the Joint Defense Agreement from Shook, Hardy & Bacon with my 
comments in redline. This agreement was sent to us to allow Enron access to 
the Power Systems' attorney's opinion regarding whether the proposed redesign 
for the New Albany and Doyle turbines might infringe GE patents.

My comments are intended to preserve Enron's rights to bring any claims that 
it may have against Power Systems. Do we have any other agreements of this 
type with Power Systems?  Some claims that Enron may have against Power 
Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods 
that are approaching.  I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review 
the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the 
allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.  Please advise if you 
would like for us to undertake this review and ensure that any claims that 
Enron may have are protected.

Thanks.

Paul,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got 
to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let 
me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.  

Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear 
that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this 
in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning 
about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about 
the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint 
testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both 
Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a 
different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). 

Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just 
spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from 
her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.  
It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement 
without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the 
joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In 
sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile 
effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now 
appears to David and me to be at a dead end.

Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing 
should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo 
underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given 
the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the "bug" issue that SGS in Subic 
Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT 
that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our 
chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I 
have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting 
the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would 
like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go 
forward.

Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and 
Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes 
Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per 
day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole 
arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the 
choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to 
worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of 
arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a 
formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already 
been accepted by Mitsubishi.

Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I 
read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim 
is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my 
last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this 
idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.

Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.

Britt

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, "pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the "pre-sale" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to "bugs". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
"bugs" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described "changes" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

We do utilize this feature.  How often it is used varies from assistant to 
assistant.  You would need to have access to a system computer or at the very 
least have the document transferred to diskette.   In the past we have not 
given up anything from our system computers.   Since we give nothing but hard 
copies, is this a problem for us?  Further, our retention policy states that 
all drafts are to be discarded once the deal has been completed.  

Would you like to see a demonstration of the track changes feature?

Have you heard of something called "Track changes"?  It's a WORD feature that 
is used -- a lot -- for redlining drafts.  I see it used all the time on 
documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.  It has become 
popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not 
compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are 
often missed in marked drafts.  
I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've 
forbidden use of "Track Changes" and are advising their clients to do the 
same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by 
someone who knows anything about word processing technology.  Which makes for 
interesting results in document discovery..... among other things.  Just 
thought I'd pass this along.

I have reviewed the proposed filings with FERC, at least the latest drafts.
There were two issues related to the definition of market power and the
proposal for penalties for underscheduling load that I believed needed to be
changed and they were.  I believe those documents will be filed in the next
few hours.

As to CPUC, Harvey Morris has been tied up on the PUC's FERC filing and has
not called us.  Mike Day anticipates a call early Monday.   So far, no news
is good news.

If you need to reach me this holiday, I will be at our house in Inverness,
California.  (415) 669-1531 and I will check email periodically. Please have
a pleasant Thanksgiving with your family.

Thanks

The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will 
hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack 
is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I 
predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack 
has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5 
million.

Hi Tanya and Debbie,

I was wondering if I could get an update as to the status of the following 
bankrupt companies:

Alma Energy Corp.
Kimball Trading Company
Southern Mineral Corp.

For each company, we have an outstanding receivable on our A/R.  I was 
wondering if, in each case, we expected to see some money to offset the 
receivable, or if there was a slim chance that we would receive anything in 
bankruptcy proceedings.  

Please advise.

Thank you,
Becky

Richard,

I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI 
trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 
15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate 
of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio 
was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill 
is for about $2,230.00.

I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay 
it.

I await your instructions.

Britt

Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no

review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the

Travis,

 I reviewed an "Agreement for Project Services" having an effective
date of May 20, 1999 and a "Project Work Description" (PWD) with a date in
the title of May 27, 1999, which includes an Attachment A.  The PWD and its
Attachment A apparently modify the 5/20/99 agreement, but reference it as
the 5/21/99 agreement in the preamble and above the signature line.  The
5/20/99 agreement conveys (in paragraphs 4.8.1 and 4.8.2) any intellectual
property rights that Agency.com may have acquired to Enron Corp.  Attachment
A, however, added a paragraph 4.10 that begins with the following sentence:
"Company shall obtain no intellectual property rights to the Work unless it
has made timely payments of all reasonable and undisputed fees."

 Please confirm that "reasonable and undisputed fees" were paid and
that there is no 5/21/99 agreement.

 Thanks.

Richard, 

Folllowing our meeting of the 9th November, I have now written a business 
requirements document, which will be included in the final specification to 
be sent out to the vendors under consideration for the supply of voice 
recording services. This document is attached below. 

Before sending out this document I wanted you to have the opportunity to 
review the content and comment upon any statements made within it. 
In order to progress this component of the ECS project we will be sending out 
a specification at the end of November, so if any feedback could be given 
before that deadline, it would be appreciated. 

I will ensure you are also sent a copy of the final specification provided to 
the suppliers. 

Thank you for your assistance with this matter. 

Regards

Stuart Fieldhouse

Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met 
Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston 
Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 
year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his 
daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded 
custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix 
called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his 
second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income 
threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to 
handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry 
company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a 
garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six 
months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year 
old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously 
considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother 
and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his 
divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is 
current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to 
move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his 
daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of 
brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in 
law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the 
mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An 
attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, 
I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on 
his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help.

I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your 
voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being 
handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next 
week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, 
I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business 
contact--a short and sweet letter should do.

Re-sending.  Hopefully you can print this one.

In connection with the APEA matter, we have been informed that Avista (Avista 
manages Clark County PUD's gas supplies for its facility) has transaction 
tapes related to Clark's declaration of force majeure that may be of 
interest.  

It is possible that we should send a request to Avista to retain the tapes 
for the dates 12-6-00 through today in case a dispute arises over the 
declaration of force majeure.  Do you think that would be prudent, and if so, 
how would you like to go about making the request?

Jay,

As I mentioned, I had met with Richard Sanders and Andy Edison earlier today, 
and they recommend that we respond to Ron's latest letter.  Richard tells me 
that, in litigation, much is made of the fact that a party did not respond to 
another's correspondence.  As you can see, I have kept the response short 
rather than rehash and contradict once more each of Ron's numerous 
inaccuracies and self-serving statements.

Pete

		 To: James Derrick/Corp/Enron@ENRON

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

Dear Doug,

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

Steve, I have received notice of service in a lawsuit styled:  The People
of the State of California, etc. v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., et al.
(including Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Energy Services, Inc.)
that was filed in the California Supreme Court, County of San Francisco
(#318189).  I know that this is not in San Diego, but wanted to make sure
that it was not the lawsuit that you were tracking earlier.  It is a
complaint for unfair, unlawful and deceptive trade practices regarding the
deregulation of the California electric power industry.  Let me know if you
think it is the same.  thanks, Becky

There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in

Hi Mary - Do you know where we stand on the release of the orginal lawsuits 
that were filed against ECT Securities and the other underwriters regarding 
NSM?  We put out a Watch Report for Merchant assets and I've sort of referred 
to that issue with a generic comment like  "Negotiations continue regarding 
obtaining releases from the lawsuits that were filed against the original 
underwriting group that included ECT Securities."

If memory serves me correctly, there was one release that was granted - 
either from Farrallon Capital Mgmt, or Oaktree?  Do you know how many others 
are outstanding.

Please let me know at your convenience.

Thnx,

Michael Tribolet:

In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court 
in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the 
rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its 
undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court 
agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass 
through the power purchase costs to customers.)

The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but 
said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to 
us to make a copy for ourselves.

Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the 
courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have 
that filing passed around to this distribution list.

Best,
Jeff

Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation

Here is the list of counsel that attended today's conference call regarding
public events involving the California Power Exchange Corporation.  I
delayed publishing this list until 6:00 p.m. because I kept receiving emails
from interested parties.  I also received the following report from John
Stamper at O'Melveny & Myers who represents SEMPRA and San Diego Gas &
Electric.

John had a conversation with Bob Moore from Millbank representing the
California PX.  Bob apparently told John that invoices for the chargebacks
will be issued on Monday February 5th and will be due and payable by
Thursday February 8th or Friday February 9th.  John asked for February 9th
rather than the 8th.  John raised again the possibility of a standstill
agreement.  Bob Moore reported that the CalPX was amenable to a standstill
agreement if everybody agreed.  They are worried, however, about being sued
for failing to liquidate collateral as soon as they are able etc.  John
pointed out that the CalPX might be subject to claims from those entities
that had their letters of credit drawn down improperly.  Bob then reported
that the number one option that the  CalPX was considering was bankruptcy.
It seems to them to be the one forum where they can get all the parties.
They are also considering dissolution and invoking the ADR procedure
themselves.

We have scheduled a teleconference to discuss the FERC options for 11:00
a.m. PST on Monday February 5, 2001.  The call in number is 1-800-205-3434,
participant code: 653687

I have also received a request to schedule an alternative teleconference for
1:00 p.m. PST to consider non-FERC alternatives.  This would include
litigation alternatives.  We will distribute the dial in number and access
code for that call on Monday morning.

Proposed Agenda for 11:00 a.m. FERC Option Teleconference:

I. Current Status of any proposed filings.
 Note:  Phil Fantle, in-house counsel for Cargill-Alliant sent me a
copy of a filing they made  with FERC on January 29th.  I will send a
copy under separate email cover.
II. Discussion of specific relevant examples where CalPX has violated
the tariff with respect to  specific PX Participants.  The purpose of
gathering these examples is to be able to  demonstrate that CalPX is
acting arbitrarily and capriciously if that is case.  This could
include identification of specific instances of inconsistent treatment of PX
Participants or  inconsistent treatment of the same PX Participant.

 For example, Phil Fantle pointed out that the way he reads the
tariff, if you look at the  chargeback formula set forth in Schedule 2,
Section 5.3, the ratio for each PX Participant  appears to be a fixed number
that  does not vary after the default of another PX Participant.     In
Phil's example, if a defaulting participant has a 25% share of the gross
MWHs sold in the Core market, during the chargeback process only 75%
of the default is paid through  chargeback because there is no provision for
recalculating the chargeback formula.

III. Summary of best arguments of why CalPX application of charge-back is
inconsistent with  tariff.
IV. Impact of Governor Davis' "commandeering" of SCE block forward
contracts.

I have been buried with your state's energy crisis and have not had a chance

Richard - Do you have any comments on the draft engagement letter that I 
faxed to you
last week?

A reminder that Roland and I are currently scheduled to have dinner with Brian
Barth on the evening of 2/7 and to meet with him all day on 2/8.  (there is
some possibility that we may ask Brian to roll this schedule one day, since I
may still be in SF in the deposition of Bill Mellin of Farallon thru 2/7

Subject: Cuiaba Call--legal issues

1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) 
reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's 
letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to 
sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There 
are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows 
whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it 
is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask 
our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  
Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, 
Electronorte. 

2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the 
ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, 
Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political 
avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, 
however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek 
assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political 
battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to 
seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to 
progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has 
expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong 
message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we 
proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 
of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at 
the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little 
time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate 
proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what 
reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure 
how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the 
commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure 
what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may 
affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look 
at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or 
express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would 
advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with 
respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand 
every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix 
developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own 
way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have 
traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who 
represents them. 

3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE 
does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the 
contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm 
told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that 
we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine 
Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our 
force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our 
position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both 
parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  
I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.

4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration 
concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what 
it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. 
Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to 
consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of 
proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a 
number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It 
needs to be subject to review as we go along.

5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going 
to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and 
get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best 
advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the 
Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so 
I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in 
the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position 
that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.
Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. 
John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I 
may be unaware of with any strategic plan.
Regards,
Michelle

Subject: CAISO Notice - Letter from PG&E Regarding Payment for November, 2 
000 Invoice


  ISO Market Participants:
  On January 31, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received
by fax a letter from Joseph C. Henri, Director of Utility Electric Portfolio
Management at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E). Mr. Henri stated that
PG&E was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO
Tariff that "Uncontrollable Forces prevent PG&E from performing all of its
obligations under the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Henri's letter identified
"government regulations and market conditions" as "forces beyond PG&E's
reasonable control."  In addition, Mr. Henri stated that the temporary
electric rate increase ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission
on January 4, 2001 was "an amount far below that necessary to enable PG&E to
generate sufficient cash to pay its ongoing procurement bills."
  Mr. Henri continued by stating that "PG&E...lacks the funds
to pay in full its bill from the Independent System Operator for November
power purchases, due on February 1, 2001."   Further, Mr. Henri stated that
"because PG&E's inability to make full payment is due to Uncontrollable
Forces, the ISO Tariff precludes the Independent Service (sic.) Operator
from imposing any sanctions against PG&E."
  Mr. Henri concluded by stating that PG&E's efforts to secure
relief from these circumstances continue and that PG&E will inform the ISO
as soon as it is able to resume making full payment for its wholesale power
purchases.
  At present, the California ISO neither accepts nor rejects
the claims made in Mr. Henri's letter. The purpose of this market notice is
to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
PG&E based on PG&E's failure to pay in full ISO invoices.

		 Subject: ENA v. Triad


Andy,

This is basically a collection action for about $1,800,000 of unpaid spot gas 
sales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least one 
address) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around 
February of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, and 
then confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms ("confirms").  Per ENA's usual 
custom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, although 
there are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these 
deals.  Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us any 
money.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 
2000.  Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in a 
recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is that 
Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.

Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent an 
arbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out a 
list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 
7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an 
extension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case.  
This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky, my legal assistant, call up 
Triad's registered agent for service of process, although the Maryland 
secretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.  
The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told 
Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) 
he was "aware of us".  This leads me to believe that the address that we have 
been using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents that 
we sent to that address.  

What I don't want to do, however,  is go all the way through arbitration, get 
a default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain that 
we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.

My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to 
send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any 
other address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, so 
that we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign for 
these things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad 
an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. 

Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likely 
that after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by it 
until, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award 
enforced.  I don't see a way around that problem.

Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.

Britt

Thanks.

Britt

kruptcy matters


Richard,
 Here is the status of the information we have about the City of Palo
Alto's request that our firm represent them in connection with the potential
bankruptcy of PG&E.  It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has
agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse
in any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from
representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue
to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to
our firm confidential information.  In particular, if Enron and the City of
Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity
litigation  (including class actions, governmental investigations and the
recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&E
for physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron
even against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of Palo
Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely
they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized
expertise of Larry Engel.  The City of Palo Alto has its own generation
capacity through WAPA (the Western Area Power Administration), NCPA (the
Northern California Power Agency), and TANC (the Transmission Authority of
Northern California).  The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron,
as I understand it.  We have specifically identified the City and County of
San Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of joining that
suit.

 Would you please let us know Enron's view of this proposed
bankruptcy representation in view of these disclosures?

Thanks
Gary

I am reviewing a contract for testing turbines with a small municipality in

they will move on this.  They also want Palm Beach County as the venue for 
arbitration.  I am going to push for a large city to ensure a decent pool of 
arbitrators.  What is your view of Miami as the venue for arbitration?

I have sat with Neale Gregson to review WFW's bill and confirmed that it does

This will follow up on my recent e-mail regarding the substantial initial

to review and apportion that  bill between his R/C and Alan's R/C.  Subject

Joya:

Please process this payment. I think we will be charging it to the Litigation 
RC. Please check with Twanda/Richard to confirm this.

Alan / Britt

I shall be forwarding WFW's bill (which includes PacMarine's bill) to Houston 
(for Joya Davis' attention) for payment of a reduced sum (SGD112,000 for 
WFW's legal fees). A credit note will be issued to us upon payment.

Britt - I don't have any comments on Clyde & Co's bill. If you are OK with 
it, I'll similarly forward thier bill to Joya to process payment. Please let 
me know.

Thanks and regards
Matt

Further to my earlier note, the rest of WFW's bill is for PacMarine's costs 
(SGD18,827.35 reduced from an earlier SGD25,000) which I also think is fair 
and reasonable.

Alan / Britt

I met with Neale Gregson this afternoon to discuss WFW's bill. We went 
through the bill item by item and I am satisfied that it is fair given the 
amount of work actually done. It is nevertheless  a hefty bill, so I did ask 
Neale for some accomodation. He has agreed to reduce the charges from 
SGD120,000 to SGD112,000. I should be xpecting a credit note from WFW. I 
trust this is acceptable to you as well. Please let me know.

Regards
Matt

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Gary,

The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR 
Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as 
follows:

b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately 
$80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction 
to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was 
acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities?

Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in 
auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in 
January in any of these chargeback calculations?"

The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for 
the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.

One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and
Kyle Kettler.

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

ISO Market Participants:

On March 7, 2001, the ISO distributed funds from the March 5 market
settlement of the December 2000 preliminary invoice.  The ISO distributed a
total of $45,779,567.97, of which $352,693.64 was applied to outstanding
November balances, and $45,426,874.33 was applied to December balances, as
shown below.   Total amounts payable to Market Participants related to the
December preliminary invoice were $1,490,781,469.67.  Accordingly, the
preliminary pay-out ratio for December was 3.05%, and the cumulative
November pay-out was 24.22%.

Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied
in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action
in federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v.
California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central
District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an
order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred
to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's
Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a
segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that
court.

Payments were made in accordance with ISO Tariff Section 11 and Settlements
and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6.

The distributions were made in accordance with the following tariff
provision:

 11.16.1 Pro Rata Reduction of Payments.
 If it is not possible to clear the ISO Clearing Account on a Payment
Date because of an insufficiency of funds available in the ISO Reserve
Account or by enforcing any guarantee, letter of credit or other credit
support provided by a defaulting Scheduling Coordinator, the ISO shall
reduce payments to all ISO Creditors proportionately to the net amounts
payable to them on the relevant Payment Data to the extent necessary to
clear the ISO Clearing Account.  The ISO shall account for such reduction in
the ISO ledger accounts as amounts due and owing by the non-paying ISO
Debtor to each ISO Creditor whose payment was so reduced.

As noted above, certain parties have defaulted on their GMC obligations to
the ISO.  The ISO has a priority claim to the collection of its GMC.  As a
result of non-payment of the GMC by the parties listed above, the ISO
reduced the amounts payable to market participants by a total of $591,798.59
to satisfy the ISO's GMC obligation.  This action was consistent with
Settlements and Billing Protocol section 6.3.1.3.  Additionally, for those
parties who defaulted on their GMC obligation to the ISO, but who were to
receive funds from the market, the ISO has reduced their payout to reflect
their GMC default.

 SABP 6.3.1.3
 The ISO is authorized to instruct the ISO Bank to debit the ISO
Clearing Account and transfer to the relevant ISO account sufficient funds
to pay in full the Grid Management Charge falling due on any Payment Day in
priority to any other payments to be made on that or on subsequent days out
of the ISO Clearing Account.

Amounts collected from any party are first used to settle that party's
oldest outstanding amount payable, in accordance with SABP 6.10.4:

 SABP 6.10.4
 The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of amounts owing to
ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of the creation of
such debts.

Accordingly, amounts received on 3/5/2001, were distributed to November 2000
and December 2000 creditors.  Payments received from parties who defaulted
in November were first applied to their November balances.  The $352,693.64
was distributed to creditors for the trade month of November 2000.

In accordance with Section 11.12 (and SABP 6.10.5) of the tariff, the ISO
will assess the defaulting parties interest at the ISO Default Interest Rate
(currently 10.5%:  prime plus 2%).

Certifications are required by Section 11.20.2 of the tariff.  Accordingly,
the ISO will provide such certification to ISO creditors.

 11.20.2 Evidence of Unpaid Amount.
 The ISO shall, on request, certify in writing the amounts owed by an
ISO Debtor that remain unpaid and the ISO Creditors to whom such amounts are
owed and shall provide certified copies of the relevant Preliminary and
Final Settlement Statements, invoices, and other documentation on which the
ISO's certificate was based to the ISO Debtor and the relevant ISO
Creditors.  An ISO certificate given under this Section 11.20.2 may be used
as prima facie evidence of the amount due by an ISO Debtor to ISO Creditors
in any legal proceeding.

The ISO will report further details on this situation when available.

What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core 
performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in 
no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on 
to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose 
at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your 
and Gary's thoughts.

		 Subject: AAA Arbitration


We should discuss Tuesday what our current goal is in the AAA arbitration we 
filed.  (An administrative conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, 
February 21, at noon PST.)

From our perspective, it would make sense to put the arbitration on hold 
pending FERC's ruling on the charge-backs.  (Based on a conversation with 
counsel this afternoon, the PX is perfectly willing to do this.)  If FERC 
ultimately rules against us, the PX would be able to assert a set-off that 
would wipe out the claim in the arbitration.  If FERC disapproves the 
charge-backs, it may be possible to resolve the excess collateral issue.

Let's discuss on Tuesday whether you agree, or whether there are reasons for 
active pursuit of the arbitration.

		 Subject: CalPX is going to court to have PG&E's ISO payment put in escrow

Earlier this week, PG&E paid $177 million to the ISO.  The ISO has not 
distributed that money to creditors because of the Enron v. CalPX suit.  As 
documented in an earlier e-mail, Chris Stokley, Murray O'Neill, and I called 
the ISO's treasurer and explained that the judge's order expressly excluded 
payments to the CAISO from the PX's general right not to pay creditors.

The ISO now informs us that the CalPX plans to have PG&E's payment 
transferred to the PX into an escrow account.  I copied the key part of the 
ISO's document below, and the full document is attached.


"Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC 
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied 
in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has 
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are 
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action in 
federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v. 
California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central District 
of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an order within 
the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred to the Cal PX 
for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's Preliminary 
Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a segregated interest 
bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that court."

I think we all would agree that the money belongs to ISO creditors, and that 
the PX has no claim on these funds.  My guess is that the PX would like to 
have this money so that it can deduct administrative expenses from it.  

If I can provide more information on this, let me know.

Subject:  Request for Confidential Information by the CPUC

To All California Power Exchange Participants:

Notice is hereby provided pursuant to Section 19.3.4 of the California Power
Exchange Tariff that the Consumer Services Division of the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC), as part of its investigation into the 
"generating,
selling, buying and trading of energy in the State of California" (see 
attached
declaration of Barbara Ferguson), has requested information that may be
confidential under Section 19.3.2 of the CalPX Tariff.  The subpoena requests
the California Power Exchange to respond to the subpoena no later than 
Thursday,
February 15, 2001, but Ms. Ferguson has agreed to extend the deadline until
Tuesday, February 20, 2001.  If you desire to assert a claim of privilege or
confidentiality pursuant to legal authority, the California Power Exchange 
will
include your written assertion of that claim, together with its submittal to 
the
CPUC, provided that it is timely received.  The CPUC has indicated that for

		 Subject: Playoff Tickets


I received an invoice this week from the Rockets for playoff tickets. We
need to make payment for the first two rounds by March 30 and decide whether
any credit should be refunded or applied to next year's tickets. The cost
for the first two rounds (which assumes 6 games) is $2,944. This calculation
is based on $944 for Round 1 (2 games with no home court advantage) and
$2000 for Round 2 (4 games assuming home court advantage). Based upon the
existing split, I need to collect the following amounts from each of you by
March 30:
Gage (25%): $736
Roten (25%): $736
Ballard (12.5%): $368
Doherty (12.5%): $368
Sanders (12.5%): $368
Eggleston (12.5%): $368
I suggest that any credit for unplayed games be applied to next year's
tickets. If anyone does not want playoff tickets or wants to opt out of next
year's tickets, let me know as soon as possible so I can make other
arrangements. Anyone not buying playoff tickets for the first two rounds
will not be entitled to buy tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 in the unlikely event
that the Rockets survive. By the way, tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 will cost
$4,976! Call me at 713/659-5100 with any questions. Max

I spoke with Jim Studdert re this matter, and he advised that he believes 
that it may be covered at least in part by our insurance program.  He is 
forwarding it to our insurers for their review.  (I understand that he's 
never gotten a definitive answer re coverage in the other NSM matters, so 
that may end up being the case here.)  I will let you know when I hear 
anything further re a coverage determination.

I do not care about the appearance.  There is no jury.  Morris won't care
and will understand why we paid for her to have a lawyer.  I do not want
Duke to have a private shot at her.

Hi, Richard.  Just checking with you about the video we were working on for 
the traders in February.  What's the latest word from our outside counsel.  
What's the future of this project?

Thanks.

Mary

That was our original plan---at this point I have no way of knowing---but I 
would guess that we would be arriving Fri morning. My life is not my own 
right now because of the crisis in California. Last night, I was named as the 
Enron rep. to the Pacific Gas & Energy creditors committee--a totally 
thankless and time-consuming job. I may be leaving for CA tonight. Either 
way, Julie will be ther on Fri.

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

You will receive this service of process today. I have already spoken with

ENA holds preferred stock in Crown Energy, but, as I understand from talking 
with Dan Lyons, we don't consider it to really have any value.  In any event, 
I will make sure that Sam knows what we are producing before it is produced,

Thomas:
On my way back to the job site after a meeting in Dever, with Rooney
Engineering. I received a call on my cell phone from Mike White site manager
for NEPCO telling me a OSHA compliance officer was on the job site. Mike J.
Mc Williams, Mike White, and I walked the site, looked at all records and
spoke with NEPCO, CIGC and Jomax personnel. MR. Mcwilliams and I had a close
out interview meeting after the inspection. He said the job site and records
were in order and no major violation were seen with the accident or the job
site. His only comment was he saw a missing clip on a out-boom. He will issue
a report on his inspection within 6 months.
Accident reports from NEPCO, Jomax and CIGC will be forward to your office on
Thursday March 29, 2001. If you or your offfice need addtional infor. please
let know.

Subject: Enron matter 

I have been asked to verify my understanding of Milbank's relationship with 
Enron for a group of Pacific Gas creditors with whom TN has been in 
discussions.? I sent them the following this afternoon:

I spoke with Paul Aronzon, the lead Milbank Tweed partner on the creditors 
committee engagement.? Aronzon said that Milbank Tweed does not represent 
Enron as general counsel or in any other significant capacity.? Enron uses 
Texas counsel when needed, but mostly relies on its very large inhouse legal 
staff.? Milbank Tweed has a large energy practice and works on transactions 
with Enron as lenders counsel, as counsel to entities in which Enron owns an 
equity interest and as outside counsel on isolated bankruptcy matters with 
Enron's in-house legal staff.? Aronzon said that if anyone has further 
questions regarding Milbank Tweed's relationship with Enron they can contact 
him directly (213-892-4377) or Lisa Mellencamp, Enron's general counsel (I 
believe that she can be reached at 713-853-3820).? Milbank Tweed will also be 
filing an application with the court, in connection with its representation 
of the unsecured creditors committee, which will list all potential 
conflicts.? This should be available on the court's web page - -? 
http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/canb/Documents.nsf? 

in the next few days.?

		 To: Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com

		 Subject: Power Exchange


The Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday.  The list included 
PriceWaterhouse, KPMG, BDO, Stonefield Josephson and Neilson, Elggren.  The 
preference seemed to be PW, in major part because it was actively involved in 
creation of the Power Exchange systems.  There was an obvious concern about 
the potential for conflicts given PW's role for the PGE committee.  In that 
regard, we were told (1) that there is a different standard for accountants 
than attorneys, (2) that counsel for the PGE committee didn't perceive a 
problem, (3) that there would be different teams handling each of the cases, 
(4) that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the 
underlying numbers (ie, that PW would at the same time be supporting and 
challenging numbers in claims litigation).  We've asked PW for assurances 
that if there is any challenge, it will be available to support the 
participants' position.  We're waiting for a response.  For the moment, no 
second choice has been identified.
Before the interviews, I spoke with Marc Cohen.  He's frustrated with Joe 
Eisenberg.  Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer 
litigation responsibility to the participants committee.  Consequently, Cohen 
went ahead and drafted a stipulation himself.  Evidently Eisenberg is about 
to sign off, and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on 
shortened time.  I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to 
prepare a liquidating plan.  In that regard, Eisenberg did go to the 
creditors committee and propose using $4 million of the $20 million of 
available cash to support a plan.  Not surprisingly, the creditors came back 
asking for $18 million.  Cohen's sense is that there may be a deal in the $10 
million range, particularly if we can persuade the trade that the 
participants may themselves have a claim against the $20 million.  Cohen is 
giving thought to how we make that case.  If we can agree on a number, we can 
get rid of the trade creditors, shift responsibility for the wind up to a 
liquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case.
Cohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE 
committee.  He's concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a 
seat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as 
Enron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of 
Power Exchange participants.  Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that 
comes with that, are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than 
encouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the 
PGE case?  Unless I hear to the contrary, I'll assume that our position in 
that regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that 
particular issue, we'd abstain.
I see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to 
release collateral.  Is that something we'd consider joining?  Bob Nelson

I figure that the draft engagement letter between Enron and AGSK got pretty
far down in your piles these last several weeks, so I am taking the liberty of
attaching the current draft to this e-mail.  This matter is sufficiently
significant that we really should have a memorialization of the terms of our

to internal operational audits.  In particular, I am interested in Enron's 
standard practice in that regard and any standard or sample documentation 
used to cover the audit reports by one or both of the privileges.  Im also 
curious as to whether the same approach has been used with respect financial 
audits regarding internal controls.  Pls let me know.

Maybe it goes without saying, but to dispel any doubt:  if the class action
suit that we discussed yesterday remains in front of Judge Whaley, and if he
handles the case out of Spokane, and if you decide that it makes sense to
retain co-counsel from Washington (a lot of if's, I know), I hope you will
consider our firm, and more specifically our office here in Seattle.  I have
defended numerous class action suits over the years, including, on behalf of
Northwest Airlines, a claim of price-fixing among major air carriers in the
setting of travel agent commissions.  As I mentioned, I also have some
knowledge about the roots and consequences of the current power crisis on
the West Coast, and I have some experience with Judge Whaley as well.  A
detailed personal resume along with a list of recent cases I have handled is
available on the firm's website (www.susmangodfrey.com).

Whether it ultimately makes sense for Enron to retain us in this case or
not, don't hesitate to call again if there is any other way I can be
helpful.

14  LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

   Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items 
of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron 
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate 
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such 
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse 
impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

   Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in 
Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company 
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and
Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or 
royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of 
which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into 
two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first 
matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and 
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the "Panhandle program," a 
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was 
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In 
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated 
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing 
to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain 
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with 
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court 
ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded 
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' 
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute 
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and 
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no 
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these 
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or 
results of operations.

   On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto 
Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in 
fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding 
property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, 
operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not 
provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and 
their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third 
parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, 
Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed 
in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court 
of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, 
business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  
After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all 
parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these 
suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was 
injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages 
attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for 
settlements or
final awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can 
be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of 
operations.

   Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial 
operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The OPUC granted 
PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent 
of its remaining investment in Trojan.

   The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to 
litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of 
Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to 
the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens 
Utility Board (CUB).

   In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with CUB and the staff of the 
OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in 
the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, CUB agreed to withdraw from the 
litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan 
litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the 
settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's 
investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, 
either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of 
ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement 
agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With CUB's withdrawal, URP 
is
the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. URP has 
indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE 
recovery of its investment in Trojan.

   Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances 
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results 
of operations.

   Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and 
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require 
expenditures in connection with the
construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for 
remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air 
Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These 
increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on 
Enron's financial position or results of operations.

   Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater 
remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur 
material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

 Richard,

 Some time ago, you and I recommended to John Nowland, and he agreed, that we 
didn't have a case against the ship or the supplier of this product ("Elang 
Crude, fit for export"), but that we would try for a quick settlement with 
the cargo underwriter.  Attached is a draft of the proposed letter to the 
cargo underwriters.  David Best, Matt Lee, and I have reviewed and approved 
it and recommend it to you.  The red-lining will of course be cleaned up.  It 
will either be signed by Jim Studdert of our insurance group, or sent by him 
with a transmittal letter signed by him.

 Please let me know whether the letter is acceptable to you.  Thanks.

Richard,

     The only significant deposition this week is taking place in Minneapolis.
 The deponent is Arthur Cobb, a disclosure/due diligence expert retained by
Robins, Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named.  Mr. Cobb's
report did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did not
designate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend his
deposition.  We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail.

     Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and
damage issues is being deposed in San Francisco.  Roland has a scheduling
conflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt.  The subject on which we want to
ask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the
initial offering.  This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, and
Jonathan is on top of it.

     I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath.  Gerry
worked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than he
thought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report.  He is
very focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30
days.  I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his best
effort going forward.  I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly.

     Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to
interrogatories from us.  It is much ado about nothing.  We just want to deal
with it in the least expensive way.

     Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, including
in CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee
conversations.  My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff,
and Natwest is trying to limit their losses.

     We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. 
It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. 
The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (pro
rata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common law
doctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault.
 The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against
ECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent
misrepresentation causes of action.  How all of this works together is
virtually uncharted.

     With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of the
defendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for a
determination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of the
current pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial.  If Enron goes
to trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs could
collect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other
defendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whether
such shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault.  We are working on a
memorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you.  I think you will
find that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we can
get the price low enough.)

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: "The
agenda will include "unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power."
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases.  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel.  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available to
participate in a conference call.  Thanks/

		 Subject: Project "Bighorn" (Colstrip Energy Limited Partnership)

Hi John.  I wanted to get you (and Richard Sanders) thinking about a request 
we have received from Owen Orndorff (who, for Richard's benefit, is one of 
the principals in Rosebud Energy Corp., the general partner of Colstrip 
Energy Limited Partnership ("CELP"), in which Enron, now through the "Condor" 
vehicle, holds a 25% limited partner interest;  CELP owns a waste 
coal-burning QF in Montana).

Rosebud has expressed an interest in filing suit against Montana Power 
Company ("MPC"), the facility's offtake purchaser, for MPC's refusal to allow 
CELP to remarket power above the minimum contract demand under the facility's 
PPA.  I will fax to you and to Richard a memorandum that the Doney, Crowley 
firm, which traditionally has done some work for CELP, has prepared regarding 
litigation theories and chances of success.  Owen has preliminarily scheduled 
a partnership meeting to discuss this issue (among others, as yet identified) 
on April 25th in Chicago.

My preliminary reactions to the Doney memo are that, at the time it was 
written, at least, there were a number of issues that had not been fully 
enough  researched for the partners to be making a decision.  I will ask 
Terry Donovan if further work has been done by now.  My initial reactions are 
that (1) having the PPA be the subject of a pending lawsuit could make our 
current efforts to sell our interest much more difficult;  (2) the potential 
is there for MPC to cook up some kind of counterclaim, which, even if not 
successful, puts additional pressure on the PPA, could draw out the 
litigation, and add costs, not to mention problems for our sale, and (3) the 
effort could result in as yet unknown costs to the partners (since, as I 
recall uner the partnership agreement, the costs would be borne by the 
partners - ??).  I also need to check and see just who within Enron is 
supposed to call the shots on the strategy for this, given that the 
investment is now held in Condor.

I will be out of the country on vacation beginning late Friday, April 6th, 
until Monday, April 23.  I'd like to touch base with you before I leave, 
since there won't be much time to develop our response to Owen prior to the 
meeting on the 25th.  At that time, we can also talk about what might come up 
on the sale effort while I'm out (at this point, there shouldn't be much, as 
Terry seems immersed on another deal).

I'll be in SF all this week trying to close on Pastoria, but am reachable at 
the office there (415/782-7800) or by pager (800/316-0430).  Thanks.

Michelle & Richard:
 I wanted to be sure that each of you were aware we have been given written
instructions from Enron accounts payable operations to send all legal bills
to a Houston P.O. Box, and not to any other address.
 In the past we have talked from time to time about each of your preferences
for sending our  legal bills. We will follow the instructions we have
received, but I wanted to be sure that each of you knew about this, and if
you still want copies of the bills sent to you for your information, just
let us know.
 Best regards,

 Bill

Richard:  when Carl and I were down in HN a few weeks ago and met with you 
and Mark, Mark had suggested a meeting on May 9th in HN to discuss all of the 
status of all of the litigation matters and to coordinate with the various 
filings being made and anticipated to be made in the bankruptcy court by EPMI 
in the PG&E case and in the PX case (or through the Creditors or Participants 
Committees).  Do you know if that meeting in HN is still on or has that 
meeting in person been "overtaken" by the Thursday afternoon litigation 
update calls?  Thanks  John

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Andy,
I need to make disclosure on any threatened or pending litigation against BAM 
Lease Company or any other party affecting the Leased Facilities. The Leased 
Facilities are the Houston, Bammel and Texas City Loops and the Bammel 
Storage Facility including the compressor sites and compressors as well as 
meters. Currently the Leased Facilities are leased by HPL Assets Holdings LP 
to BAM as assignee of HPL. BAM will be leasing the Leased Facilities back to 
HPL under the sublease. Can you let me know if there is any threatened or 
pending litigation involving these entities or assets specifically--as always,
 I appreciate your help--

Sandi

Participant:

Pursuant  to  your  written  request  and  in  accordance  with  the 
Preliminary
Injunction  issued on March 5, 2001 by the Court in Enron Power Marketing, 
Inc.,
et  al.  v.  California  Power Exchange Corporation, USDC Case No. 01-00901, 
the
California Power Exchange Corporation (CalPX) applied cash collateral 
maintained
by Enron Power Marketing, Inc. in payment of the following invoices:

          Dec RT F   $ 15,297.24
                Jan RT P    $ 64,547.04
                Jan RT F    $   2,255.74

Enron Power Marketing, Inc. has not restored such collateral.  Please be 
advised
that  the  Preliminary Injunction requires CalPX market participants to 
maintain
their current levels of collateral while the FERC Proceeding and the 
Preliminary
Injunction  are  in  effect,  and  allows CalPX to take any necessary actions 
to
preserve such collateral.

Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be

		 Subject: Settlement


Natwest, McDonald, and PaineWebber have collectively offered the
Farallon/Oaktree plaintiffs (and maybe Legg Mason, I am not sure) $13 million
to settle.  It is clear that this group hopes to persuade SDI and Enron to
contribute something to such a settlement, but they told Hennegan that they
would fund the full $13 million themselves if necessary.  Hennegan is asking
for something in the "high $20s"  I am advised that the settlement group is
prepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.

I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,
except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as one
might expect.

If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron to
contribute.

Richard,

Please review the attached fax from Ben Ogletree, one of Natwest's lawyers,
especially the four attached agreements (which Natwest already has.)  Can I
represent to Natwest that these four agreements, along with the Oaktree
settlement agreement, constitute all settlement or cooperation agreements that
we have with any parties to any of NSM litigation?  If I can say that, the
issue of ECT Securities' deposition goes away.

		 Subject: Enron v. Calpine


 Andy:

 To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpine
matter.

 I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone on
Friday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the office
until May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.
I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was
"working on" getting me a reply.

 We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make a
settlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion to
compel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its power
purchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for a
protective order which would limit their production to the contracts in
ERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motion
to continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summary
judgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but the
court ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of its
ruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Our
supplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,
Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order from
the court requiring us to produce additional information on our damage
claim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which we
detailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to update
some of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman's
deposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.

 Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon's
deposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduled
for June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In addition
to the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleading
amendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. We
have already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We have
drafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the case
was removed from state court and we were still on the state court original
petition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleading
ambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsic
evidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.

 I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to our
settlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if you
have questions or comments on any of these matters.

 Best regards,

 Bill

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word 
document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed 
automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been 
telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if 
they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention 
period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine 
Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston 
Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris 
County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson 
(an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck 
negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as 
a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the 
course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of 
it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine 
Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston 
Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris 
County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson 
(an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck 
negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as 
a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the 
course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of 
it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first 
time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain 
check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am 
here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am 
in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am 
and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy 
in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about 
lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?

it's tough because for a huge city with lots of lawyers there really aren't 
many business trial lawyers there.  its not like texas or california.

we know david boies well and have done a number of things with him.  he might 
be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile.  
of course, tho, he is stretched way way too thin and doesn't really have that 
much depth in his firm.  we could pitch it to him that we'll provide the back 
up, if you want.

another idea is david foster at willkie farr.  widely regarded in the city as 
one of the best trial lawyers. confidentially, we will be opening a nyc 
office by sept, and are negotiating with foster about his joining us.  i 
could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of 
him.  again, we could provide coordination and back up if you like.  of 
course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new 
york and california, less learning curve, etc.  i am a member of the new york 
bar as are about 8 of our partners.

 Per your request for an update:

 1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in 
this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

 2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our 
solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar 
defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

 3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % 
reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, 
Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, 
Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim 
again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do 
not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

 I will keep you advised.
