 this. I don't think you've been to this yet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Kathleen,

I will try to take this one it.  There is a charge for it (I think) that the 
department picks up.   

By the way, have you been invited to the ENA law conference at the 
Woodlands?  We need to get you in on that one.  

Talk to you soon.

Kay

What could be better than a meeting on an interconnection agreement?

I know I need to organize another turn of the C&E agreement.  I'm going to 
give it a look and see what open issues we might have.

Kay

PS  Isn't the weather perfect?  I thought of our friends in VA and NC with 
the hurricane remnants headed their way.  Hope it isn't too bad.

Subject: Re: 97 10 form epc contract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just want you to know that I should be getting an EPC  form to work on from 
EECC re 9710. I didn't get to discuss this with J. Schwartzenburg on Friday, 
since I didn't see him for after work on Friday.  I opted to see Michael 
instead since I had been out of town.

I've got the form break out contract for the LM 6000's.  I'll get it ready 
for you to review re the ESA deal.  It will probably take me a few days to 
get it in shape to let it go.

Hope you've had a great weekend.  I don't  think the weather could have been 
better.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to check to see if there is a "go by" affiliate EPC contract, 
destined to be 97 10 compliant?  I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's 
standpoint.

Thanks,

commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be 
confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and

Kathleen, you  haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?  Could 
you get the  names of the active development companies so that we can address 
those, as well as ENA?

I haven't seen a copy of the Sept 28th letter yet, but I've been at an 
offsite, so I might have missed something.  I'll get you a copy of CO #1.  CO 
#2 has been transmitted to GE for comment.  I'll have to confirm the status

Kay, I was hoping you could provide me with executed copies of Change Orders 
1 and 2 and the September 28th letter agreement regarding Enron's title 
acceptance of units 1-6 and 9-14.  I need to provide them to WestLB as the 
ADA requires prompt delivery to them of executed contracts.

Also, where do we stand on Change Orders 3 and 4 and the ENA/ESA "MOU"?  I 
know that the last I heard Sheila was working the MOU, but I thought you 
mights know as I am writing to you.

Thanks, Lisa

Subject: SW 501D5A Damage Claim

Janet and Dave:

As I believe you both know, the generator for the former CALME 501D5A for 
which we are now responsible was damaged beyond repair during shipping. Under 
the turbine purchase contract, I believe we have a strong LD claim against 
Westinghouse which could amount to a couple million dollars or so. I am 
currently in the process of working with EE&CC on transitioning commercial 
responsibility for this turbine and any LD claims from EE&CC / CALME to ENA 
East Originations. Unless you direct me otherwise, I intend to pursue the LD 
claim we are due under the contract. Of course, I will be working in 
conjunction with ENA legal (Kay Mann) and EE&CC.

I wanted to make you both aware of this as one or both of you may receive a 
phone call from EE&CC who might have a different view as to the appropriate 
course of action.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

Ben

Subject: CRRA LOI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi guys,

In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:

1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel 
Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know 
this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the 
construction activities.

2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple 
contracts. Does anyone care?

3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail 
the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a 
proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full 
reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up 
the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel 
cells failing to perform? 

Thanks,

Kay

FYI re: getting your blood typed at MD Anderson Hospital, Donor Room (see

card, they will mail it to you which takes 7-10 working days.

here is what people need to know - it will save A LOT of calling around...
to get the blood typed (if you don't already have a card or letter from dr.
stating blood type)- you go to the MD Anderson Hospital, Donor Room in the
purple zone, 1st floor.  The phone number is 713-792-2626.  There is an $11
charge to type the blood.  I was told that I would be given a card with my
blood type.

a 20year old (I can't believe it) and a 6 year old (even more unbelievable),

had a lot of ear infections, and it seemed to be painful.  But she out grew

Subject: Re: CRRA LOI  

Let's meet in the morning and discuss the LOI.

Kay,

To briefly answer your questions, we are contemplating another layer of 
documents with the EPC contract.  There will also be a Development Agreement 
that outlines our development activities and our nonrefundable fee.  I don't 
read his comments to mean he only wants one EPC contract.  Let's discuss 
tomorrow.  Also, we've told Bob Wright that if the plants don't work, the 
state gets its money back.  I think he and everyone involved would be 
amenable to a performance band provided that a comparable reduction in price 
accompanies the reduced performance (to the 10 percent floor, of course).  
This LOI outlines the EPC contracts only.  The Development Agreement will 
cover our fee.  So, no, our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to 
perform.  We will have some risk on BOP if the plants fail.

What time works for everybody?  How about 9:30?

Heather

Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract;
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this
time and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes
arising from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
appreciated.

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Kathy,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Mr. Schrum,

I attended Sing! last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her 
Tri Delta friends.  I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which 
were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing 
to tell you how much I enjoyed it.

I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the 
indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was 
beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children 
present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there 
were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the 
first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother 
to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring 
Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't 
offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at 
intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.

Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion. It was 
offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university 
which prides itself on "encouraging contributions toward the well-being of 
humanity".  My husband, Neil, who was a Pike at SU in the seventies, joins me 
in this request.

Thank you,

Kay Mann

To all:

Attached below please find a draft of the CRRA Filing with the DPUC regarding 
the fuel cell transaction.  There are several points that remain open that I 
would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me 
know if we've left anything out or if we need to delete anything.

I think this is a good start to us meeting our compressed timeline.  Do not 
hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever.  The next few weeks/months are 
going to be very busy, but I know we can get to the goal line.

To quote Dave Delainey, "Go, go, go."

Heather

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Ben,

I got  a call from Mike, and he gave me his lawyer's telephone number.  He is 
very interested in the change order, of couse.  Do I have the pay off number?

What would be a good time to talk about the ABB payment allocation with 
Herman?  I really want to put that issue to be, because I don't know if we 
can't put the stuff into TurboPark if we haven't taken care of it.

I'm getting GE consent to put the Coral turbines into TurboPark, if 
necessary. That doesn't mean we have to, but I don't want to take any chances.

How would you feel about not having the 1000 call and just having the noon 
call? That would give me time to talk to ABB, and we would be able to get the 
LLC agreement back to Coral.  

Thanks,

Kay

We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the 
latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they 
acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).

Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into 
TurboPark.  I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the 
following week. FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding 
agreement to see them the turbines.  If it would work to keep them in WestLB, 
that's great. However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of 
stress for you two.  I'll manage Coral and Ben.  Please advise.

Ciao,

Kay

Subject: Carlos Sole

Barbara and Peggy,

I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
transactional work in Mexico. He assumed "first chair" responsibility for all 
the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
excellent addition to our group.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.  

Kay

Kay, I have told Rob that we are not pushing GE for this point.  WestLB is 
plenty protected without it.  If GE gives a yes to the change on Monday - 
Great!  If no answer or answer is no - we take what we have.  Therefore, 
please log  call into GE on Monday am and let them know we need an answer on 
Monday and would appreciate if they would accomodate us.

"WestLB is an express third-party beneficiary of this Consent."

Please forward the revised draft of the GE Consent to Winston & Strawn

Kay:

Lee Johnson and John Ayres are going to meet Monday morning at 8:30 to go 
through all the technical information in the contract to confirm everything.  
They should get back to you very quickly with any changes.  I think the 
primary thing they are discussing is using a combined guarantee rather than 
single unit.

Thanks,

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

Just wanted you to know the docs went out Friday night.  I guess you figured 
out from Janet's comment that I did not get Ben's initials on the documents.  
She wasn't upset about it though.  Anyway, just wanted to acknowledge my 
mistake.

See you and have a good weekend.  I had to come in today to get some stuff to 
work on for Stuart.  I think I will go by Hebert's on the way home!

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Kay! How are you guys doing? We had hoped that maybe we would be coming
over to Houston Saturday to see UT play baseball and then maybe try to see
yall Sunday before we drove back. BUT! As luck would have it, Annie, Katie
and Bobby are all various degrees of sick.

So, unless there is miraculous improvement in the next 24 hours, it looks
like we will be staying in Austin. Oh well. We hope to make another trip
down there before too long.

Well, I'm due at school, but I wanted to say hi and tell you that we won't
be coming down. I hear that Mac is coming down? That's great. I hope that he
likes what he sees at UH. You know his girlfriend has been offered a
scholarship to Rice, I think.

Anyway, Have a great Ground Hogs Day. It doesn't feel too different to be
40, rather than 39 and 364 days, so I guess I'll make it through the day.

Take care and tell everyone hello!

Love you!

Lisa

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there.

Nothings comes off the list.  New additions are as follows:

New transaction with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, relating to the creation of 
a jointly owned control area to address generation,  transmission, and retail 
load delivery.  It is brand-spanking new, so I don't know much more than 
this.  It is being handled by Ozzie Pagan.

New opportunity with New Jersey Natural to develop projects using Fuel 
Cells.  Heather Kroll is the contact.

Sale of Blue Dog (GE) turbine.  Likely buyer (at last word) is NRG.  Could be 
complicated if GE protests.

There's a rumor that we are buying some new turbines from GE, but I haven't 
been contacted.  The rumor came from 
GE reps, who asked if I was working on it.  Sheila isn't handling, either, 
last I knew.

Everything else is the same.  I expect to be in NYC in the middle of the week 
to continue negotiations on the Co Op City deal (with Mark Bernstein).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay

To: Barbara N Gray/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc:  

Subject: Update on what I'm working on.

Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on:

Co Op City asset management arrangement:  In this deal, Enron would build a 
small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op 
City.  We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas), 
market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.  
We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the 
balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I 
will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.  
Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO 
Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would 
like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.  

Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have 
developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me 
about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted 
Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of 
experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for 
some information on his background.  

SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the 
equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of 
this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a 
turbine/generator set) to Calpine.  

Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a 
company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We 
received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.  
We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them 
buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and 
the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as 
funding is figured out.

There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.

GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a 
standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be 
buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.  

I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.

Kay

Kay:

I don't see a problem with reaching agreement on one form (Kendall LLC) and 
then duplicating it for the Titan project if we transact on both.

I am expecting a call this morning from PSEG's developer to discuss site 
visit(s) and the due diligence binder(s).  I believe that they are serious on 
moving forward on the Kendall project.  I will determine their interest in 
transacting on the Titan project.

Since we are not asking for any money down, I would like to be able to keep 
marketing the sites until the transaction closes.  

It is still unclear to me how the closing would go on this deal.  Would they 
sign the SPA and wire the money simultaneous with our signing over the LLC 
member interests or would these events occur on two different dates?  Let me 
know how you see it happening.  It seems to me that we could make it all 
happen at one time.

On the NRG call, I am waiting to hear back from NRG.  Based on my discussions 
with them yesterday, Friday is looking like a tough day for the call (Ben is 
unavailable in the afternoon and the NRG guys are travelling in the 
morning).  Either it will happen Friday afternoon without you/Ben (commercial 
issues only) or we will set it up for Monday.

Fred,

If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to 
the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have 
to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I 
brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have 
they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still 
kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's 
most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue 
marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?  
I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!

On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the 
customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000 
times better, if this is at all possible.  In that won't work, I will have 
more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

I don't get why we're changing this document at this time.  This deal has 
already been signed by the landowner and Herman said it was o.k. as it

The only thing we decided to do was keep track of our renewal option since at 
the time it comes up we will exceed the 5% deal.

Gentlemen,

Does the Mississippi constitution impact the issue?  The munies are 
specifically citing Section  100 of the Mississippi constitution, and have 
faxed me an opinion of the Mississippi AG interpreting this section. If you 
will email me your fax number I will fax it to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greg,

I've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it.  However, it doesn't 
answer the question for me as to whether a Mississippi court would uphold 
such a clause, or how other contracting parties have dealt with the issue.  
Due to the importance of the issue I will consult with a Mississippi firm to 
get a handle on the question.

Thanks for your help,

Kay

Subject: Mississippi AG's Opinion on Section 100

As an update to my earlier e-mail, I located both the Miss. AG's Opinion
letter construing Section 100 and the initial request from a State entity
that prompted the Opinion.  

Assuming a State entity is a party to a contract, the AG's Opinion does not
opine that Section 100 prohibits contractual clauses that exclude
consequential damages.  Instead, the AG's office could not find any
statutory authority that allows a public officer to contractually limit a
private vendor's liability to the State entity.  Although the AG did not
state that such clauses are prohibited, the AG held that it could not
affirmatively sanction such clauses in the absence of statutory authority.

As I mentioned (or you've heard), a group of us are planning a trip to the 
Lake Austin Spa, beginning May 4.  I think I will probably stay 3 nights, but 
the Spa will give us these rates for 2 night stays.  The rates are group 
rates, but a group only takes 6 people.  I'm going even if we don't get 6.

I will try to block some rooms next week so we hold spaces.  Please let me 
know if you are interested.

Subject: Escalade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it, however, 
we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the extra wood 
package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we asked for a 
price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.  They offered 
to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.  When we priced 
these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package 
instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a 
third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these 
options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to "work on it".  The fellow 
you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay

What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

Subject: New Power Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FYI.  I don't know what I think about this email.  I will say that I've heard 
good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.  Also, there is a big 
difference between a transmission project and a power project, since 
tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint.  
Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally 
or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions.

Subject: New Power Project

Understand from John Moore that there is a new solid fuel power project being 
discussed for the Brownsville area, and that you will be involved.  I would 
really like to talk to you about this at your convenience.  As you may know 
from John, we have been very involved with the Tex Mex transmission line 
project that we have done with BPUB and that has just received board 
approval.  We have a very good relationship, I believe, with BPUB, the Port 
of Brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction.  John also 
seems to believe the deals with BPUB and the Port will be structured along 
the same lines as the transmission project, and as the draftsmen for not only 
the docs with BPUB, but also the Port,  we are also obviously very familiar 
with these documents as well.  

Could we possibly talk about this project at your convenience?  We would 
really like to do a deal with you and your team and given our background on 
the first project, it would seem to make a lot of sense from your point of 
view as well.  I would be happy to drop by to discuss staffing, timing, etc. 
whenever it would work best for you.  

Many thanks - look forward to hearing from you.

Hi there,

I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main 
one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in 
this deal for a little while.

Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks 
ago.  

Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in 
the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss 
it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just 
have to figure out the paper trail.  

Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.

Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.

Talk to all soon,

Kay

Subject: FW: Blacklined Draft from Last Night's version

Kay and Catherine,  several comments jumped out from my quick review of the 
below for each of you.

Catherine and Kay:  What is the ENA Demand Note amount in 2(a) supposed to 
represent vs the Purchase Price in 2(d)?  Are the amounts correct?

Catherine:  Please confirm number in 9(a)(xviii).

Kay:  There seems to be a timing problem with several of ENA's reps in 9(a).  
Several state that the LLC has not engaged in any work/liabilities type stuff 
other than the Transaction which includes execution of the Turbine Contract.  
The Turbine Contract is an exhibit.  I assume it is the current contract 
which has been executed, through assignment, by E-Next Generation LLC. In 
9(a)(xvi), we say that we will have essentially "ownership" of the Turbine 
Contract "at closing".  This seems to also contradict the earlier reps on our 
execution of the Turbine Contract.  How could we make the first reps when our 
LLC didn't execute the Turbine Contract?

Thanks, Lisa

I came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for, but yes, it 
is a deliverable.  The Delta deal is being financed, so they are asking for a 
lot of docs, including a letter from GE counsel.  

To make it more fun, there are complications with the GE consent on the 
Pastoria deal.  It is not a happy time between GE and Enron, but I hope it 
will smooth over quickly.

More to come.

Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like 
this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really 
unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.  



Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was

I just spoke with Marvin, he seems pretty happy--just a few comments so far:

? weekends are not included in the definition of off-peak hours

fyi, Steve should work with Ms. Clark to determine amount of payoff is

We have discussed with GE et all the prospect of a changed order to the

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

Subject: Status of Various Delta Items


Kay:

I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues:

1.  I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the
non-disturbance lien document.  She said they will be using a securities
account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept)
rather than a non-disturbance lien.  She said they are working on these
documents and will furnish as soon as possible.

2.  I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory.

3.  I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE
acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical
issues.  She is considering this.

4.  She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is
consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE
as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday
4/20.  The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the
documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance
funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding.  Please
advise on this issue.

I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement
within a half hour or so.  I reminded him of the need for a W-9 and an
incumbency certificate to open the escrow account.  (Estelle Lawrence has
also called looking for the escrow agreement).

Hi Ed,

Here's a certificate of incumbancy we need to Jake's Delta deal.  Can you 
handle signature?  We can work with a fax today, but will need a fully 
executed original for the bank.

Jake, we put a couple of Houston guys just in case something comes up.  We 
have assumed that you will be executing the docs.  If there's any problem 
with the list, please let me know.

We need this document to set up the escrow account today.

Thanks,

Kay

We may want to go ahead and circulate the ENA Incumbency Certificate for the
escrow.  I was holding it until the Salmon Incumbency Certificate revisions
were completed by Paul Hastings so that the two documents could be
circulated simultaneously, but I'm not sure they will get that document to
us in time to do both together.  Thanks.

David Duran can sign the certificate.  Can he certify his own name?  If so, 
we want him to also be a signatory.  Authorized signers should be Dave Duran 
(managing director),  Michael J Miller (vice president) and Kevin Presto 
(vice president).

Kathleen, please verify the way these guys like to sign their names, and 
current titles.  Let me know if you think we should use someone else.

Chris, we need a name and a call back number for whoever will be watching for

Nearly final docs.

The change they want in the LLC is the addition of a statement indicating 
that for tax purposes this is a  single member LLC, or something like that.

The promissory note is felt to be necessary due to the adjustment mechanism 
for any change orders.  Has something to do with them getting all the basis.

Isabel,

Please confirm before 830 central this morning (when GE's rep will be in my 
office to sign docs) that these documents have final approval of GE's 
counsel, as I believe Kent is not available to review documents today. 
Obviously, I cannot present revised documents to a commercial representative 
of GE without knowing that his lawyer has signed off on the documents, except 
to the extent that the changes are obviously minor.

The following are my comments:

  - I assume that Settlements is fine with invoicing no later than the 7 th 
of each mth.
  - Section M:  Should we go this route (covenant of financial support) or 
would we be accomplishing the same if we structure this as MDEA, agent for 
..., similar to that in the Interconnection Agmt.  We should probably look 
into it further for the longer term deal.  I don't know which has the 
stronger fall back to the municipalities.

Here are the issues I see with their draft:

Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to 
others. This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full 
contract in place.

Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel 
oil.

Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.

Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.

Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the 
market.

Subject: Open items for MDEA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities 
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

        Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this
        matter.  I will drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if
        he objected.

        John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation
        of a draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available
        today to discuss this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.
        Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling
        arrangement with Ken.

        Thanks,

I don't think the stock price is the key piece of the puzzle, as it doesn't impact value of the biz.  It is all about keeping the banks at bay and DYN interested.  Stay tuned for "restructuring plan" (aka layoffs) next week.

Fingers crossed?

Is Enron in default under the Sandhill agreements?  How about any other deals you know about, including the Mexico stuff?  Have you inherited Peoples (enovate) yet?  I suspect there may be a default there.  

I'm helping gather some of this info, and your help would be appreciated.

Travis,

The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak.  Eric is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.  Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through Eric.

We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).  We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.  Cheryl was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.

I'm still here.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.
