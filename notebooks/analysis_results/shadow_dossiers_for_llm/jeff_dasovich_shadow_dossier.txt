Attached are the draft message points.  As always, all comments, suggestions, 
etc. are encouraged and welcome.  I have five minutes.  Consequently, based 
on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up 
emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to 
round things out.  Joe/Mary:  any final word on format/participants?  Thanks.

Greetings folks.  We should decide how we want to handle.  One thing I'm not

the write up?  If we're called on to discuss, do we simply discuss orally,

Greetings.  Kim's stuff looks pretty good to me.  There's a pretty high 
likelihood though that I won't be in class Monday or Tuesday either.  That 
means I can't turn in whatever it is we're turning in tomorrow (if I sound 
clueless, it might be because he ran out of handouts in the first class 
describing how the cases would work, and there's nothing posted on the 
site--apologies).  I can do the write-up for next week.

Hello fellow E220 mates,

Attached are my attempts at Q1 and Q3.  I will not be in class Mon or Tues.

Jeff, can you hand the case in?

I am happy to take a crack at the other questions, let me know if you would
like me to help out there.

The xcel file is a little messy, it was really just a work sheet to play
around with the numbers, but you are welcome to it.  In terms of format,
since there is no guidance, I say we do it however we want.  We could
answer the questions in prose style, for example.  The write up should be
no more than a page and a half - but that is just my humble opinion.

Cheers,

I think the answer to #1 is:  as much as possible, but I'm not altogether 
certain--pretty sure that our preference would be to use our own internal 
construction folks as much as possible.  Answer to #2 would be very 
interesting; I don't know the answer, but I'm sure that it's tightly linked 
to the answer to #1.  I think you might want to start with Shelly Corman to 
find the right contact for the pipeline constructions.

I leave for S.D. tonite.  I'll give you updates as the day transpires 
tomorrow.

Rick --

The information below is very helpful for Government Affairs across the 
country.  I have a few other questions to support our advocacy:  

1. How much of our new power plant development is not subject to Building & 
Construction Trade Labor Agreements? 

2. Does Enron have any specific policies on whether or not we should use 
Union labor on our construction?  We recently established human rights and 
environmental policies, I am wondering if this applied to Unions?

3. Do you know if the pipelines are also using Union labor on their 
expansions?  Or maybe, who could tell me?

Thanks.

Jim

Sandy, I was again disapointed to hear that Union leaders are accusing Enron 
as being unfriendly to Labor.  In the last 20 months we have pursued 
construction on over 3000 MW of new generation capacity.  
Enron Development Activity subject to Building & Construction Trade Labor 
Agreements
California 
 500 mw - PDEF - FeB. 99
 750 mw - PEF - Feb. 2000
Indiana
 550 mw- Westfork Development -  Oct. 99
Illinois
 680 mw - Lincoln Energy Facility - Nov 99 
Tennessee
 540 mw -  Gleason Power I - Oct 99
Oregon 
 240 mw - Coyote II (planned January 2001)
 Ethynol Plant - Columbia County - Baugh Const. June 2000

Hopefully this will prove to be valuable information:  In addition to the 
direct agreements, Enron is pursuing third party projects in Chicago and New 
York City that will be subject to labor agreements.

If the parties are interested, feel free to have them contact me directly 
503-464-7548
Regards, Rick Johnson

Here's my cut at #3.  I haven't had the benefit of Kim's answer, but made 
some assumptions and took a shot.  Likely to doctor it up a bit, but wanted 
to find out if folks are in agreement or if you think I've lost my mind.  Let 
me know.  #3 is somewhat at the heart of the questions, so I want to make 
sure that I get your feedback.  And my apologies for not having gotten you 
something sooner.  Be on the look out, there is a cold going around that 
really kicked my butt over the last week.

and Dylan.  Check it out.  Still need to determine if folks are comfortable 
with my conclusion in #3, i.e., look, the biz model and the info provided in 
the 10K may be crap, but from a strictly technical perspective, Patten's 
justified in using the sales as opposed to the installment method.  Let me

Subject: Re: Q2 for Patten Case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, nice spreadsheet.  Two minor questions: 

1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes 
on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather 
than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?  I 
think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized 
income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment.  If so, I think 
they actually get a 46%  tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose 
using a cash basis.  Still a loss, just not so big.  Anyway, I'm not sure if 
I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers.

2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?  For example, does 
shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is 
now a loss, rather than a gain?  Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash 
basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal 
out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the 
asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same).  
Seems like they might need a liability like "deferred profits" or some such 
thing, such that the ["deferred profits" +  revenues (recognized on cash 
basis)] = notes receivables.

Anyway, I may not have this right, but thought I'd bring it up to see what 
you think.

Best,
Jeff

Let's try this.  Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.  I 
won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.  And if 
someone does, the other needs to bring it up. But Prentice, if I say, "that's 
critical" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think 
it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.  So I'm willing to 
have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, 
too.

I hope you'll going sailing today.  Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?  I 
also left my gym bag in your bathroom, which has my sailing shoes in it.  I'm 
at work.  You can call me here.

Jeff, I love you, but I'm unhappy.  I just don't want to be criticized
anymore.  The thing is, I know you think a lot of it is funny, and I've just
lost my sense of humor, but the truth is, after a while, it's just not funny
anymore.  Like when you yawned last night when I was telling a story to your
friends.  Yes, it's funny.  But when you do it every time, after a while, it
just starts to hurt my feelings.  That's just one recent example.  You're
often telling everybody how neurotic and fucked up I am.  Or how I'm totally
overbearing about playing the banjo.  In fact, you just said that today to
my friends at Haas.  Do you know how embarassing that was for me?  You
should listen to yourself when you talk about me in front of your friends or
my friends or my family.  How often do you say nice things and how often do
you criticize me?  Why don't you ask them and see what they have to say.
I've tried to talk to you about it.  I asked you to spend some time trying
to say mostly nice things, just for a little while.  But apparantly, you
either can't or won't, and the end result is that I feel like you just don't
care.  I'm sure there are things you want me to do.  I'd like to try to do
them.  But I don't know what else I can do to make you understand that I
just can't take all the criticism from you anymore.  It makes me feel like
shit.  I don't know where else to go, Jeff.  I suggested talking to a
shrink, but you're not willing to do that either.  I'm sure that half of it
is my fault, and I'd like to work on this together, but you don't seem to be
willing to work on the one thing that's really hurting me and that I've
asked you to work on.  And maybe that means you need to think about how you
really feel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi:  O lord.  You know, the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have 
time to think about things and absorb it.  But work has gotten so insane that 
I sympathize with your plight (since mine's the same).  I think I've maybe 
made it to 1/2--that's 1/2--of the finance classes.  

NORTH of Sacramento.  Are you driving to Sacramento every day?  Say it ain't 
so.  That's brutal.  

When you say full time, you mean school full time?  That, I assume, means 
leaving your job?  Be happy to talk about it.  You know me---believer in 
always keeping all options open and active.  If full time makes sense, you 
ought to do it.

Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'll be missing class (again) on Tuesday 
because I have to be in Portland.  If you're not going to Sac on Monday, 
coffee in SF during work hours works.  Or I could meet you during break on 
Monday.  Or we could have lunch or a beer after work on Thursday or Friday 
when I'm back from Portland.

Hang in there.  I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground 
again.  Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.  Let me know 
what works for you.

Best,
Jeff

PS  I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case.  
Hope that's modest consolation.

"Strategizing?!"   (I don't think so.)

 I'm on a (fairly)good project at HP..IN SACRAMENTO,
in fact 20 miles north of Sacramento. I LOVE the
company, the learning, the work, the teams, the
people, the career opportunities.  I hate the 4+ hours
of driving on Mondays and Tuesdays, strategizing(real
word?) about balancing the needs of the team with
getting my ass to school. I really want to talk to
you...I'm thinking about full time and want your

beer?

I've got a few too many speeches coming up.  You are probably in the best 
position to address this crowd (time for the student to teach the teacher), 
but I'd understand if you think it would be awkward (the we should just 
decline).

Steve:  Let me know if you'd like to discuss.  I like Tim's idea re: maybe 
you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think 
you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with 
Schroeder re: Littlechild.  

Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I 
had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind 
contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost 
of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am 
surprised to see it turn up in print.  

Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about 
this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In 
fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one 
but that we're always interested in working together.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, I sent this e-mail to Kean last night.  I am fine with your 
recommendation for Skilling to pass on this event.  Do you want to deliver 
the news to Lee.  Do we want to offer you, Steve Kean, or me as an 
alternative?  Personally, I would like to attend but don't have much interest 
in speaking (assuming that they would allow low lifes like you or me to 
speak).  Your call on all of this.  Call bob Badeer with questions about the 
BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours.


Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the 
best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our 
powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my 
view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.

Also, one question:

Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have 
that right?

I just received this e-mail from a former professor of mine at Berekely.  
Dasovich knows more about this than I do, so you should definitely talk to 
him.  Do you think that this is something that Skilling should attend?

Jeff and Tim,

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk "Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation."

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

FYI, we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with
Sue and Robbie et al.
They indicated they could use Steve's help face to face at some point.

We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues, case
law and MSA self-certification language, and let me know if you have
additional items.

We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the
CPUC.  Let me know what schedule works for you.
Also, can you confirm the correct names, email addresses, titles for
those new folks on Friday's call: Robbie Rossi, Michelle, Melissa Lloyd?

Thanks.

Subject: Weekly EES meeting

Highlights of today's meeting:

Next week there will be a big push to get contracts signed from the First 
Energy customers from whom we received commitments.  There are approximately 
120 MWs of load we hope to sign up, using First Energy's Market Support 
Generation.  We also need to prepare a PR plan in case our contracted load is 
significantly less than our acquired generation.

Cinergy is being targeted as a new commodity opportunity.  The intent is to 
take advantage of the shopping incentive made available to the first 20% of 
load that switches when the Ohio market opens 1/1/01.

The Texas Commission's ruling allowing negative stranded costs will not yet 
be marked into the retail curves due to the uncertainty surrounding the 
decision.  

Personnel issues:

Mark Courtney is now the regional sales lead for Texas, replacing Jay Ferry.

Eric Letke is now the regional sales lead for California, replacing Doug 
Condon.

Yes.  You can expect it this weekend.  My apologies for being tardy.  Also, I 
think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California 
Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.  I can make a contact and I 
don't think that it's too late to try.  He'd be very good.  Very close to the 
governor.

FYI.  How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the 
table for some time.  I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a 
good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to 
the current framework.  

As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy 
Market conference last week.  The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also 
spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go 
up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other 
options--with him.  

My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the 
Wright meeting last week.  With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a 
very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for 
PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.  It 
might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright 
meeting.

Best,
Jeff

Harry:  

Seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that EES is in the 
loop.  Assemblyman Rod Wright's trying to find a solution that the whole 
industry can embrace, which he'd then foist on the Governor.  Sandi, Parquet 
and Day attended the first meeting last week.  I'll forward to you Parquet's 
notes from the meeting.  We'll be setting up a call in number first thing 
Monday morning.

Subject: Re: Agro - Q3,4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm adding my two cents.  Here's 3, but not 4.  Few things.  

1) I considered that everything was "material."  That reasonable? 

2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided 
it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of 
inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.  But a case for extra can still, 
be made I think.  

3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, 
since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken 
in 1994, as opposed to a "potential litigation outcome" that they'd make an 
allowance for---I could be wrong, though.  

4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included 
in the 1995 "income from continuing operations" number, and consequently 
included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit 
line item in the income statement.  

I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and 
circulate.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Agro - Q3,4


Questions

1.  Litigation - how should we account for the 1994 bill of 500,000 in 1994
- I assume this was not accounted for in the 1994 income statement - we
could include a note on pro forma numbers for the 1994 statement or we
could just include this cost in 1995 - I am including it in the 1995
recalculated income statement, but I don't think this is totally accurate.

Thoughts anyone?

2.  In the text, page 354, Other gains or losses from the sale or
abandonment of PP&E used in a business is not supposed to be reported under
extraordinary items.  This means the two sites Agro sold for $750,000
(after tax gain) should not be counted under extraordinary items.  In this
case - we could 1) assume this is accounted for already in the 9.5 million
number given to us or 2) add it in after "income from continuing
operations" and before "discontinued operations."  I went with option 2.

Let me know if you have any issues with this treatment.

3.  Are we supposed to do anything with the 30,411,380 of retained
earnings?  I did not include pay out of dividends in the income statement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK.  Having taken a second look at the spreadsheet I sent yesterday, here's a 
revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's 
#4.  Most significant issue:  the discrepancy between Kim's and mine is that 
Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain 
on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add 
them).  No big deal, we just need to make an assumption and go with it.  
There's a couple of other differences that are identified in the answer to 
#4--again, just need to make the call either way.

Jeff

Thanks.  I'll soften the expropriation language.  I don't think they can 
disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire 
package appears to be one  negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to 
be agreed to, or no settlement.  But you're point's well taken and I'll try 
to acount for it in the answer.  Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact 
that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report.  Seems like I'd 
have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted 
it to it in my annual report.

If I don't see you tomorrow, have a good week.

Jeff,

Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday, 
and I was out of town
until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a 
few points, but I am
not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes:

On the expropriation:

In the write up we say "We agree with the executive that Global should report 
the expropriation
contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were 
met:  1) sufficient
information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be 
reasonably estimated.
Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major 
industries.  "

The book says "The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public 
or private
declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise 
or actual
expropriation of assets of other enterpises." I would argue that Matuto was 
not the government and
therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office. 
It also says FASB 5
requires the two accrual criteria to be met.

As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and 
nationalization of resources
was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995 
that the government
intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the 
telephone company took
place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think 
they should not accrue
in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the 
asset was fully functional
and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they 
should disclose that the
possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not 
accrue..

I disagree that the company should cease use of the patent infringing 
technology, I believe that
companies frequently make conscious business decisions to infringe upon 
patents. Since I agree that
an accrual is not in order, perhaps a general disclosure regarding patent 
litigation should be
made.

The book states that "If there are several aspects of litigation, each of 
which gives rise to a
possible claim, then the accrual criteria should be applied to each possible 
claim...."

Thus I think we should break up the product liability suit into pieces. 
They've agreed to pay 1M
for lost rentals. This should clearly be accrued, assuming it hasn't been 
paid yet. The tenants
claims are expected to be settled for 1M, this too should be accrued. The 
surrounding property
claims are not estimable, and therefore should be handled with a disclosure.

Greetings Professor:

I'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and 
have been called out of town on business at the last minute.   As a result, 
if I make it to class at all tomorrow, I unfortunately won't make it until 
after the break.  While I think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to 
class tomorrow, I wanted to plan for any mix-ups (contingencies?) by emailing 
a copy as well.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Update--Day 3 of California PUC Hearings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.

Thanks for the articles.  Well, not quite in PJs, but yes, working from home, 
which is some consolation.  PG&E has said that a signficant share of gas 
suppliers have stopped transacting with PG&E due to credit risk.  Our 
exposure to PG&E is huge (both EES and ENA), so I wouldn't be surprised if 
we've stopped transacting with them until the Commission comes out with its 
decision on the 4th and we see how the ratings agencies respond.  I can find 
out first thing Tuesday morning.

And a very happy and safe new year to you, too.

Jeff

So are you in your PJs working at your computer at home?  Just teasing!  
Thought you'd be interested in these LA Times articles.  FYI, I got two calls 
yesterday (Dow Jones and Bloomberg) about us refusing to sell gas to PG&E -- 
all the traders were gone, so I couldn't get an answer and Steve didn't

Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely 
to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.  
Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing 
"credit receivables" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that 
the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with 
it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing 
conference on Wednesday.  Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.

But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be 
significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron 
meters.  Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the 
"complex process"  of changing-out the meters.  In addition, when CA border 
gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch 
from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.  SoCalGas submitted an 
emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the 
Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.

It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of 
all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.  Otherwise, we may 
find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of 
EES' exposure.  Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the 
utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned 
negative on ESPs as a result.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: 

These 3 issues will be discussed at your Tuesday afternoon meeting with EES:

what to do about forcing the utilities to pay delinquent PX credits
Through December, the total arrearage is about $220M total, mostly from 
PG&E.  Neither utility is paying.  Vicki Sharpe is lining up bankruptcy 
counsel.

should the new 1 cent surcharge be passed on to our customers
Vicki has not said yet whether our contracts allow passthrough, although she 
has hinted it would require a very aggressive interpretation of the contract.
 
should we try to return our customers to utility bundled service
Aside from the modifications to our customer contracts that have to take 
place, an even stickier issue is to get the utilities to take them back.  
Even if the utilities are required to do so, forms have to be processed and 
meters have to be changed out.  (We have our own meters on our accounts.)  
This could not happen quickly.  Of course, this action mitigates against the 
risk of the rate freeze ending but does nothing for the credit problem, other 
than to keep the exposure from getting larger.

On Wednesday, there will be a pre-hearing conference at the CPUC on the next 
phase of the end-the-rate-freeze case.  Jeff and I have talked about this and 
think we can decide what our involvement will be (witnesses, positions, etc.) 
after a schedule is set.  For now, the strategy is to make sure the CPUC on 
Wednesday adopts a schedule that deals with all the issues they must deal 
with about the rate freeze. 

(Rick, I will be in San Francisco through Wednesday meeting with Mike Day and 
working with Roger Yang to identify all those issues.)

Subject: PG&E Advice Letter Implementing Surcharge


Something I forgot to mention in the last e-mail regarding PG&E's Advice
Letter implementing the surcharge is that they  appear to have gone a step
beyond what the Commission directed them to do.

The Commission directed them to create a balancing account to track the
revenues obtained from the surcharge (just in case, in the unlikely event,
they have to refund them).  PG&E created the balancing account for this
purpose but also stated that they would transfer (on a monthly basis) any
ongoing procurement costs which were not recovered through the TRA (i.e.,
from ongoing revenues) to this new balancing account as well.  It is unclear
what PG&E's purpose is for doing such except  maybe to stop the
undercollection in the TRA from getting any bigger and hope that they will
have a better shot of recovering undercollections in the new balancing
account.

Again let us know if you want us to comment on the advice letter with
respect to this issue and the direct access issue mentioned in the previous
e-mail.  Energy Division only has five business days to review the Advice
Filing -- so any comments/protest of the filing must go in early next week.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Jeff,

Per your request, I am writing a brief note to follow up on our
telephone conversation today.  As we discussed, Enron plans to change
the structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C
corporation to an LLC.  As we discussed previously, this change in
structure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities
Commission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of
the Public Utilities Code.  You indicated that someone inside Enron was
concerned that, during the course of the CPUC,s review of the request
for transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax
returns of ETI,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would
find unattractive.  You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.

At a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over
entities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.  Depending on
the facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this
jurisdiction.  However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look
into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant
telecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking
to acquire control of the carrier.  For nondominant telecommunications
carriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch,
because such carriers have no market power.  You should also be aware
that there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's
financial information from public disclosure.

Thus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review
the books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in
connection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.  ETI is a
nondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of
ETI, because EBS will still be ETI,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC,
rather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management
personnel of ETI.

The one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the
Commission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.  While this
logically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably
trigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.

Please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss
further.

SPB

Subject: Summary of Proposed Short-term Solution for California's Energy
 Crisis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dean Tyson:

It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet you 
and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I 
wanted to summarize where we left off at today,s meeting regarding California,
s energy crisis.  That summary is attached.  I've also attached three 
articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolster 
our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meeting.

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy is 
a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, it 
appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that success 
requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.  
The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed that 
all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot. 
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of 
success and is greatly appreciated.  

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made at 
the meeting.  It represents a &first cut,8 it will undoubtedly change as the 
details get worked out, and I,m sure I,ve missed something.  So please don,t 
hesitate to edit the draft.

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal 
internally.  As such, I can,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the 
proposal.  But I,m confident that the company can support something akin to 
this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.

In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has played 
a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and 
analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort as 
well.

Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washington 
D.C. office.  If she can help in any way, please don,t hesitate to let me 
know.  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to 
discuss things further.  My home phone is 415.621.8317.

Best,
Jeff

RE: Legislative status report week ending 1/19


RECENT EVENTS:

-- The first two special session bills were signed by the Governor this
week: AB 5x (Keeley), relating to reconstituting the ISO and PX governing
boards, and 6x (Pescetti/Dutra), relating to utility retention of assets.
Includes in AB 5x was language requiring the ISO to make a list of
California power plants that are out of service due to either a planned or
unplanned outage available on the Internet on a daily basis.

-- Governor Davis has announced some appointments to the new ISO Board.
They include: Michael Kahn from the EOB as chair, Maria Contreras-Sweet who
is the Secretary of Business Transportation and Housing, Carl Guardino from
the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, and Mike Florio from TURN.  The
fifth position still remains vacant.  It is unclear if FERC will even
approve this new makeup.

-- SB 7x (Burton) caught everyone,s attention this week as it was
introduced, maneuvered through the legislative process and also signed by
the Governor within a 24 hour period.  SB 7x clarifies the authority of the
Department of Water Resources on a temporary basis to purchase electricity
(in lieu of AB 1x).  It gives the agency a 12-day window to purchase
electricity and sell it at cost. The legislation specifies that no contract
may be entered into later than February 15, 2001 and it sunsets on that
date.

-- The next legislative step taken this week was to continue the progress
made in the Assembly last week on AB 1x (Keeley/Migden).  AB 1x authorizes
the Department of Water Resources to contract with any person or entity to
purchase electricity for up to 5.5. center per kWh.  The Senate Energy
Committee met Friday afternoon to debate the measure.  Committee members
themselves brought up a number of concerns, including those previously
articulated by IEP and some member companies.  Specifically, IEP opposes the
5.5 cap and language that implies entities that &furnish8 power would be
&public utilities.8  Both were highlighted in today,s hearing by the Chair
of the committee and the author as provisions that need to be addressed
before the bill moves forward.   The committee expects to be drafting
potential amendments over the weekend  and will resume deliberations on
Monday at a time to be announced.  I am faxing the amendments proposed and
submitted to the committee by Southern for your review which address these
issues and more.

-- Senator Burton also held a press conference this week to introduce SB 6x
which would create a state power authority that has the power to, among
other things, finance the construction of additional generating capacity and
provide financing for older plants to make necessary retrofits for
efficiency improvements.  Power generated from this financing will be sold
to the state at cost.  The press release is attached.

-- Still sitting on the back burner for the moment (which could change at
any moment) is any legislative play on long-term contracting and siting
changes.  IEP has provided comments on both issues and is participating in
any discussions on these issues as they arise.

-- Last but not least, the QF issues has reached the legislative arena this
week.  Asm. Keeley has been intent on getting all the parties together to
negotiate the SCE QF contracts.  Negotiations will continue through the
weekend.


UPCOMING EVENTS:

--  There will be a Senate Energy Committee hearing on Monday to continue
deliberations on AB 1x (Keeley).  So far, I have no other scheduled meetings
or hearings for next week.  Stay Tuned.

ABX1 1 (Keeley) Regarding long term contracts with DWR was heard in
Senate Energy today for the purpose of considering amendments.  The
following items were discussed:

The portion of the bill that would make entities who sell to the DWR
regulated utilities will be amended.  This was not the intent of the
author.

The $.5.5 will be amended as the author and committee acknowledged that
it was completely impractical.  No indication as to what the new number
would be, although it is likely that there will be a number versus being
silent on the issue.

The bill will be amended to allow for portfolio purchases.

The bill will be amended to eliminate the prohibition on the state
owning T&D.

The five year sunset review may be reduced to a hard three year sunset.

According to the author, it is not the intent of the bill to enable IOUs
to repay past debts with surplus revenue if the state is able to buy
inexpensive power and there was room under the existing cap.  Consumer
advocates believe under this scenario there should be a rate reduction.

QF contracts are a major stumbling block as they have not been paid by
the IOUs and would prefer to have contracts with the state.  Under this
scenario, the $400 million would be far too small a number to make up
the net short.  Current negotiations with the IOUs have ground to a
halt.

Several parties suggested that the DWR also be authorized to make gas
purchases.

The Calpine proposal of 2,500 mw at 5.5 was deemed insufficient due to
its complex structure, thereby reinforcing the notion that 5.5 is not
feasible.

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies "going forward"
Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details.

Greetings:

The CPUC held an emergency meeting this morning in which they restated the 
utilities obligation to serve regardless of claims of bankruptcy or any other 
insolvency. PG&E had indicated to both the ISO and CDWR that they had only 
planned to schedule for load in which they had native generation to serve. 
PG&E's logic is?probably that they will cover folks with the?assets they 
have, but since they can't buy anything, they shouldn't?carry that 
obligation.? CPUC doesn't like that logic, although if bankruptcy happens its 
about the same effect?as?imposing that obligation on DWR.? This could be 
avoided if they would just impose the rate increase?that will cover the 
costs, subject to refund, and then get the long-term?deals in place.? At this 
point the utilities have?much less to lose.? Please find the attached 
decision.? For those of you who would like to listen to the hearing you can 
listen to a rebroadcast by logging onto the CPUC web site.

Once again ... my sister was called by a reporter with the SF Chronicle
who's doing a story on  Enron.   The reporter heard about how my sister
escaped escalating  electricity costs in  San Diego because she switched to
Enron.  Sounds like a positive story.  May run this weekend.

Are you rethinking your decision about pulling out of the residential
market?  I would think  you could  sign most of San Diego.  When and if you
decide to reenter the market, we have some ideas we'd like to discuss.

Sue, who's handling pr for ARM?

Best to you both,

Ray

??????? Brian - This is a  copy of an emergency petition to modify the gas 
accord decision that was filed  yesterday.? It basically requests that 
penalties to core customers for  diversions be waived and any diversion be 
priced at the market price up to $50  per dth.? Unfortunately, we felt it had 
to be filed because we couldn't let  the core be exposed to $100 per Dth gas 
supply when PG&E can't buy at $10  per dth.? Hopefully, the crisis will be 
resolved and petition will have no  bearing.? 

??????? It was mailed to the  Gas Accord service list and our legal division 
e-mailed to an unknown service  list which I had wished they hadn't done. (We 
are not trying to add to any  problem, but based on a worst case scenario we 
couldn't have the core exposed to  buying $100 per dth gas for all its gas 
supply)???

You need to be aware that we are in the process of selling the Wind Co.  Mark 
Metts and Amit Walya are working on this.  If the price changes under the QF 
contracts it would impact the sale.  Call Amit to discuss (345-5570).

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies "going forward"
Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details.

I'm taking Dylan's and Mark's stuff, adding a bit, and putting it into memo

answers to questions, per se, just a 4-page (or so) memo.  I have that 
right?  I'll circulate the memo later today, or first thing tomorrow in the 
AM.

Thanks, Sandi.  This tracks very well with my chat with Barbara.  Barbara's 
charcterization of "irrelevant" arguably makes sense from a customer's 
perspective, but it's very relevant to us, though I didn't give Barbara the 
details of why it's so important for us---just explained that some of our 
customers, given their contracts with us, would get hurt.  

Seems that the important take away is that 1) they are actively negotiating 
the "end" of the rate freeze, 2) customers get hurt from a retroactive "end" 
and 3) one "freeze" will the replaced with another, that is, prices will 
continue to be capped going forward (despite the "end" of the rate freeze).  

Seems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze "ends" next month, 
or next year, which is something that we're going to want to follow very 
closely.  Do we have any information on where the negotiations between 
customers and the utilities ended up this weekend? 

Best,
Jeff

Hi, Sandi.  Per your request, I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening.
I had been in a meeting with Keeley, Wright, et al after the hearing.
Jeff's proposal was not entirely clear to me, but it seemed to focus on
specifying an end date for the rate freeze in the Hertzberg bill.  I
noted that the focus of the Friday hearing and the subsequent meeting
was on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to
recover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to
another.  Therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is
rapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into
the first issue.  This does not seem very likely right now.  Who knows
how this will evolve, of course, but there is a sense of urgency, at
least in the Assembly.

Take care, Barbara

OK.  Jimmie and I duplicated effort just a bit.  Attached is the memo and the 
spreadsheet.  Note that in the memo, we have a dispute about whether $750k is 
adequate.  Therefore, I've left questions 4 and 5 attached to the memo for 
you folks to reconcile (if they take advantage of discounts and get A/R and 
inventory rates back in line with '93 rates, is $750 enough?).  

Also, I've included a common-size income statement in exhibit 1, a cash flow 
statement in exhibit 2, and I, too, completed exhibit 3.  We may want to 
clean up some of the calculations in the spreadsheet, given that we'll likely 
need to turn them in as attachments.

Hope this helps.  I'd do more, but I'm off for the airport and New 
York--won't be in class tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff

To simplify the analysis, I completed Exhibit 3 for 1993, 94, 95 for clarkson
in the attached spreadsheet.  Whoever calculated ROA forgot to add interest
expense and used year end assets instead of average.  For ROCE again, average
instead of ending should be used.  The level of current liabilities jumps out
when you compare it to the rest of the industry.  Dylan is right the growth
in inventory is also alarming.  I will look at the data some more tomorrow.

On Friday, the Commission issued the attached Assigned Commissioner's  Ruling 
in the rate surcharge proceedings which does the following:
?
1.? It identifies the issues for Phase 1 as being:
?
(a) Reviewing the independent audit results of PG&E and SCE, ordered in  
D.00-12-067 and, as part of that analysis, determining whether or not there 
is a  financial necessity for other or additional relief for the utilities.?  
Included here is a recognition that the utilities may make other interim  
proposals and this would be included within the scope of the first phase;  and
?
(b) TURN,s accounting proposal for the proper reconciliation of the  
Transition Revenue Account (TRA) and Transition Cost Balancing Account 
(TCBA)  accounts and the Generation Memorandum Accounts (GMA).
?
2.? The retention of utility generating assets and the interim  ratemaking 
treatment for these assets is being separately handled and hearings  will not 
occur on this issue in Phase 1.? Parties may file testimony on  interim 
valuation in addressing whether the rate freeze has ended on a  prospective 
basis.

3.?? The Commission will consider whether the rate freeze has  ended only on 
a prospective basis in Phase I.

4.?? The Commission will address the reasonable and prudent  cost issue in a 
later phase of this proceeding.

5.?? The  Commission will also consider parties, proposals for tiered rates 
similar to  those discussed by Senator Bowen in the December public hearings.
?
6.?? PG&E and?Edison are required to?notify the  Commission and all parties 
by January 30, 2001 of the specific portions of their  testimony that are 
within the scope of this phase.
7. The hearing schedule adopted is:? 

February 5,  2001?????????????  Intervenor testimony served
February 9,  2001?????????????  Rebuttal testimony served
February 15 )21, 2001?????  Hearings
February 23,  2001??????????? Closing  Argument
February 27,  2001??????????? Briefs,  not to exceed 15 pages
March 23,  2001????????????????Proposed  Decision
March 26,  2001????????????????Final  Oral Argument
March 27,  2001????????????????Anticipated  Final Commission Decision
?

Cheney: White House Mtg Mon On Calif. Pwr Problems
01/28 10:13 (DJ)
Story 0076 (EIX, PCG, SRE)

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said on Fox News
Sunday that the Bush Administration will hold a cabinet-level meeting Monday
on California's power problems.

Cheney also said that it wouldn't be his choice to have California take
control of the electrical industry within its borders.

"That wouldn't be my choice. I'm a believer in markets, and I think the
notion of deregulation is basically sound. What happened in California was
it was poorly executed," Cheney said.

He added that the state's regulatory scheme has undermined the financial
stability of utilities, which have run up several billion dollars in debt
without being able to recapture it.

Cheney also said California's problems are partly a result of supply,
because no new power plants have been built in the state in 10 years,
despite the fact that there has been a rapid run-up in demand.

"It's really up to California to change those laws, both to restore
financially solvency to the utilities as well as to make it possible to
start building new capacity."


Cheney said a big part of the problem is the process for siting plants,
which involves an endless appeals process. While it's relatively easy to
stop a project from going forward in the state, it's very hard to get final
approval for a project, he said.

"California is probably the toughest state in the country...in which to
build a power plant, and when you add to that the pricing scheme that is in
place, there is no incentive for anybody to go invest in additional capacity
in California. And investing in new capacity is what is ultimately going to
solve the problem."

Hi, Sandi.  Per your request, I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening.
I had been in a meeting with Keeley, Wright, et al after the hearing.
Jeff's proposal was not entirely clear to me, but it seemed to focus on
specifying an end date for the rate freeze in the Hertzberg bill.  I
noted that the focus of the Friday hearing and the subsequent meeting
was on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to
recover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to
another.  Therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is
rapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into
the first issue.  This does not seem very likely right now.  Who knows
how this will evolve, of course, but there is a sense of urgency, at
least in the Assembly.

Take care, Barbara

Subject: Ken Lay's Meeting w/Davis' Energy Advisors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Friday, I attended a meeting with Ken Lay and Karen Denne that Mike Peevey 
and David Freeman requested.  Mike Peevey was President of Southern 
California Edison before founding NEV (which he eventually sold to AES).  
Freeman is General Manager of LADWP.  

The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor.  Freeman is the 
Governor,s chief negotiator responsible for signing power contracts on behalf 
of DWR now that the Legislature has passed AB1X and the Governor has signed 
it.  John Burton, the leader of the State Senate, is responsible for getting 
the Freeman the job of chief negotiator, but Peevey was clearly in charge.  

Also at the meeting was Vikram Budraja, former SVP of power systems and 
planning for Edison.  He,s now a private consultant that Freeman hired to 
help him with the contract negotiations.

Peevey asked for the meeting to urge Enron to respond to DWR,s RFP issued on 
Friday.  Peevey/Freeman want to announce a package of deals on Tuesday.  They 
implied that they,ve already got some deals done and expect to have 8+ deals 
to announce on Tuesday, though they gave no details other than to say that 
they,ve got a deal with Calpine (as reported in the press).  Their plan is to 
announce on Tuesday the names of the suppliers they,ve signed with, the total 
number of megawatts signed, and the average price per MW.  They are concerned 
that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual 
deal, which for obvious reasons they don,t want to do.

Peevey and Freeman also said that they don,t want to sign too many long-term 
contracts though they recognize that there,s a trade-off between term and 
price.

Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond.  ENA is preparing a response.  He 
also told them that EES was working on a plan to reduce demand at our 
customers, facilities and that the plan would be completed and ready for 
implementation very soon.

I,ve summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peevey 
and Freeman:

It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that DWR 
is creditworthy.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st*to 
purchase the power necessary to fill the utilities, short position.  Ken Lay 
pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds 
needed to pay suppliers.

The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposals.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
Be as creative as possible.  All offers will be considered (despite the 
language contained in the RFP).

The only customers who have been protected from California,s failed 
restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct 
Access.  In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California,s 
shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site 
generation.  Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally*as 
AB1X does*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.

Response from Peevey:
He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.  He 
affirmed what we already know*that the head of the Senate oversight committee*
Debra Bowen*is working on a &clean-up8 bill to remove the prohibition.  In 
response to Ken Lay,s points that California needed to make sure that utility 
interconnection and stand-by rates didn,t continue to impede on-site 
generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the problem 
and was prepared to fix it.

Siting laws have got to be streamlined and California (i.e., the Governor) 
has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants in 
order to push the forward curve down.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at 
expediting siting and development.

DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts 
supply-side bids.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce the 
signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators that 
DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a &reasonable8 price.  They 
also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very 
unlikely to extend the DOE order forcing suppliers to sell to the IOUs.  Once 
they,ve shown that they can manage the supply side, Peevey and Freeman said 
they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding.

These are the highlights.  I,d be happy to give more details on the Monday 
morning \call.

Best,
Jeff

We are not scheduled to turn this in and I don't think it will help at all 
with grading.  I have looked at the case but frankly I have to work both

Hi Leslie:

The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to 
reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for 
such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to 
"produce," it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to "reduce.")  That proposal 
was distributed to the usual, company wide email distribution list last week 
when it was submitted.  We can discuss further on the phone call this morning.

Apparently there are rumors that Ken Lay promised to make some kind of

million in DSM?)  Do any of you know what this commitment might be?  Sandy

I apologize, but I won't be in SF Monday evening, and this week coming up 
will be a grinder.  I have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend, 
though. I can provide a fax number tomorrow where the materials can be sent 
to me.  And I assume that they are on the Izio site, too.  I'm going to go 
there now.  Tomorrow, I'll try to crunch some numbers and outline the 
one-pager and distribute to folks by the end of the day.  Then perhaps we can 
email each other on Monday and try to make some progress on the memo by the 
end of the day.  That should put us in pretty good shape to finish it up 
Tuesday and Wednesday.  If I can't get the materials off of Izio, I'll let 
you know.  I'll report back in the AM tomorrow with a proposed game plan, 
once I've collected all the materials and pondered things a bit.  Sound 
reasonable? Thoughts?  Just let me know.

Mark, I hope that if you're in Denver, that means you're skiing.

Best,
Jeff

How about talking Monday pm?

There were a ridiculous amount of handouts again on Thursday, some of which
directly related to next week's assignments.  I thought the quiz was
straight forward enough.

Mark - my mom and I were going to go to the Pottery Barn Kids in Corte
Madera on Saturday, so perhaps we could stop by your house to drop off
copies of the handouts on our way in or out.  Send me directions again to
your house if you would.  

I'm not sure how we can get copies to you Jeff.  I could drop them off to
your place in SF if that works.  Let me know.

Jeff, Mark:

Wondering where you were yesterday. Hope you didn't
forget about the in-class quiz!

The next HW and writeup due next week seems like
a heavy one.
Do most of you have Monday off? I'll take a look at the
case/HW Sa/Su, and prefer a meeting / conf call anytime
Monday. Perhaps PM in the city if folks are working
that day? Sunday PM (after 7) works for me too.

Jim:
It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversation, 
this email includes the following:

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lands.

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on how 
to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR,s ability to 
sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two 
possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC 
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through 
rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I 
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and proposed 
amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable 
option.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near- 
and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your 
office tomorrow detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will 
also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our 
proposed language.

I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact me 
if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anything 
else that I can do to assist you.

Regards,
Ken

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a 
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been 
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract 
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit the 
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for 
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce 
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by 
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of 
distributed generation.
 
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with 
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor,s executive order regarding interconnection is a 
step in the right direction*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete 
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this 
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed 
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when 
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome 
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent 
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from the 
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be 
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., &on-site8) generation that is 50 MWs or 
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and 
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale 
generation faces.  

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru 
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant 
output apply equally to smaller scale, &distributed generation8 facilities. 
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to 
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial 
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects.  
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase 
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities 

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with 
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the 
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk 
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion,s share of counterparties share Enron,s credit 
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and 
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to 
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements 
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to 
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our 
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the 
California PUC,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As 
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates 
adequate charges to cover DWR,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract &Prudence8
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public 
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are 
&imprudent.8  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then refuse to 
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power 
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree 
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that 
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
 
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to 
Recover DWR,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority 
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to 
the specific ratemaking &mechanics8 that AB1X directs the PUC to employ to 
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it is 
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure 
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it is 
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in 
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR,s power purchase 
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since 
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover 
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk 

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk 
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the 
PUC would accept as &prudent and reasonable8 all purchase costs incurred by 
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to 
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the 
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political 
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file 
entitled, &AmendAB1X.doc8.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and 
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to 
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly more 
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic 
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC 
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, 
&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.8)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR,s RFP, we are willing to accept 
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit, 
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have 
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR 
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through 
contract amendments.

4. California,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports 
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ 
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All 
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer 
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are 
likely.  

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this 
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our 
estimates.  California,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well 
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operation 
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power 
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the 
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to 
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the 
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply.  
California,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this 
requirement.  

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early 
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's severe 
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced 
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the 
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current 
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be 
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of 
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more 
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000 
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California 
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California,s 
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We will 
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing 
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's 
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.  
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less 
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor,s executive orders and Senator Sher,s siting reform legislation 
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve those 
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face 
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit 
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron,s 
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) 
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an 
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund 
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected air 
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the 
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing 
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the 
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished most 
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund 
to finance DWR,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more 
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would 
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., 
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to 
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To 
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment 
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the 
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, &Deal 
Bench,8 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price 
for hour-ahead power in real time. 
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment 
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be 
paid for load reduction (&Negawatts8).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include:

&creation8 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, particularly 
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation 
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California 
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in 
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk 
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to 
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for 
responding. 

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in 
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for 
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate 
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 times 
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates 
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and 
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market*Legislative vehicle: 
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were 
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy 
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from 
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove the 
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a 
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department of 
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from 
customer migration.  

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when 
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procurement 
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial 
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should 
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement 
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a 
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California 
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in 
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments 
of utility load.

Return California,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency*Legislative vehicle: 
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand.  
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California,s supply-demand 
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers 
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California 
State government assume the role of &electricity buyer8 for an extended 
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence 
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to 
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a 
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate 
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without 
&shocking8 the economy or household budgets For example, California could 
amortize the recovery of the utilities, past debt over a 5-10 year period.  
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways: 
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in 
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 
1890.  Second, California can &net8 the revenues the utilities have received 
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they have 
accrued due to the retail price cap.

don't need to do it that way.  Also attaching files (one each for each of the 
scenarios asked for, so that folks could see what I did).  Have not 
constructed the "one-page attachment, however.  Let me know what you think.

Jeff:

I just got done ready your memo.  I really liked what you have done.  I did 
not want to make any direct changes, but rather just pose a few questions 
for discussion.

First, when I calculated how long it would take to purchase the shares 
without debt I did use the net income number.  It might be better to change 
them to the operating cash flow number.  If you guys would like, I can 
recalculate them.

I agree that having higher amounts of debt will fend off take overs.

Are we planing to calculate the amount the tax shield will increase the 
value of the company.  If we assume that the debt will be held in 
perpetuity, we can directly compute the amount.  Let me know and I can run 
the numbers.

Also, Jimmy when you do the color graphs you want to do.  Try some MM pie 
charts (just kidding)

Good job,

Subject: Calif Gov Fiddles As Summer Likely To Burn

POWER POINTS:Calif Gov Fiddles As Summer Likely To Burn
   By Mark Golden
   A Dow Jones Newswires Column

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Once there was a bride whose pianist became ill the
night before a beachfront wedding. As she frantically tried to find a new
pianist, the radio blared an alert: A 40-foot tidal wave was headed
straight
for
the beach.
  "I just will not let this pianist ruin my wedding," muttered the bride as
she
turned the radio off.
  California Gov. Gray Davis and the state Legislature have no better sense
of
priorities than the bride did. They've been obsessing over the financial
solvency of the state's utilities for three months, instead of making
progress
on the bigger problem: the huge shortage of electricity expected to hit the
state this summer. California's multibillion dollar purchase of the
utilities'
transmission lines won't add one megawatt to the supply of electricity.
  How big is the imbalance between supply and expected summer demand? The
California Energy Commission forecast two weeks ago that the
60,000-megawatt
system might just squeak by with 87 MW to spare in a bad heat wave. But
nobody
takes that forecast seriously.
  The CEC's numbers are way off base. California's electricity demand could
exceed supply by 5%, or 2,000 MW, on days with typical summer weather. That
2,000 MW shortfall will be made up by turning out the lights in 2 million
homes,
or a mix of homes, businesses and industry. A bad heat wave would get
shortages
several times that size. As the blackouts roll through parts of the state
every
weekday that temperatures are at or above normal, every business and home
will
take its turn at getting by without electricity for an hour or so. What
factory
can operate under such conditions? Will the state's elderly survive the
heat
exposure?
  The CEC put the capacity of generators in the state at about 54,000, but
it
used original capacity figures. Most of California's big power plants are
more
than 30 years old. They can't produce as much power as they once did, so
subtract about 7,000 MW from their rated capacity.
  About 15,000 MW of the state's capacity is now controlled by merchant
energy
companies Calpine (CPN), Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy (DYN), Mirant (MIR),
Reliant
Energy (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB). They say they already have sold much
of
the power they will generate this summer to out-of-state western utilities.
But
the CEC ignored that.
  Hydroelectric generation in the western states is expected to be just 60%
of
normal this spring and summer. Western utilities have been buying up
supplies
since last fall. California's PG&E (PCG) and Edison International (EIX)
couldn't
do that, of course, because they're nearly bankrupt.
  Nobody knows exactly how much power has already been sold out of state. A
trader at one California merchant power company estimated 5,000 MW. In a
recent
auction of transmission line use, capacity to move electricity out of
California
sold for up to 15 times the price of transmission capacity to move power
into
the state.
  The CEC ignored the sales of California power to out-of-state generators
in
its rosy summer outlook and ignored the forecast for below-normal
hydropower,
which depends on winter snowfall. The snowfall season is three-fourths over
now,
making a hydropower shortage pretty much a done deal. Yet the CEC used
normal
northwest hydropower production in its forecast. Take off another 2,000 MW.
  The commission expects 3,000 MW of generators to be off line for
unplanned
repairs when the heat wave hits. That's California's historic average. But
outages usually increase dramatically during a heat wave. Take off another
2,000
MW.
  The commission expects all 1,000 MW of Davis' recently announced peaking
generators to be on line for the summer. "No way," says the industry.
  Instead of the CEC's estimate of 61,000 MW, then, California can expect
available supply of only 44,000 MW. The state needs 51,000 MW to meet
demand
and
maintain recommended reserves in the kind of heat wave it gets, on average,
every two summers.
  People in the industry have been telling the governor for nine months
that
there's no way to raise supply to meet demand this year or next. Siting and
building power plants takes too long. Demand has to be reduced to the level
of
supply.
  The current course is to reduce demand through blackouts. Pricing offers
a
better way. If the state raised electricity rates immediately - a step no
longer
opposed even by California consumer group The Utility Reform Network -
California would stop burning through the natural gas and water reserves
needed
to keep generators running this summer.
  Davis insists on solving the crisis without a rate increase big enough to
damp
demand. Several western U.S. utilities outside California have already
imposed
such rate hikes. Davis is focused on buying power, even though California
can't
subsidize consumption of artificially cheap power much longer. The
Department of
Water Resources is signing 10-year power supply contracts at hefty prices
that
fully reflect today's supply-demand imbalance.
  Instead, he should be addressing the imbalance, which must be dealt with
sooner (by prices) or later (by blackouts). Raise California rates
significantly
now. Cut demand, and the wholesale price for electricity comes crashing
down.
Then sign long-term contracts at the lower rates.
  Davis is committing California's citizens and businesses to 10 years of
overpriced electricity. After that, he says, he will try to reduce demand.
His
streak of bad decisions in this crisis continues unbroken.

Attorney/Client Privileged Information

Summary of our follow-on discussion with UC/CSU Friday afternoon (Tom/Dennis 
from Enron):
1.  UC/CSU's goal is to reach agreement on the interim solution by the end of 
next week (Friday, 3/2)
2.  UC/CSU would like draft language memorializing the structure contemplated 
below by COB Monday, 2/26, and asked what our proposed form of agreement 
would be (letter agreement, amendment).  Their preference is the first and 
expressed concern that if the draft had too many legal terms and/or was too 
one-sided, that it would be unrealistic to expect approval by Friday.  I have 
since spoken to Mike and I will propose to UC/CSU that we get them a term 
sheet on Monday for discussion, with the intent of wrapping the terms into a 
letter agreement of a couple pages.
3.  UC/CSU is considering underwriting the risk they would be absorbing 
through the interim agreement.
4.  It is both our expectations that during the interim period we would gain 
some clarity on the legislative/regulatory landscape such that we could begin 
working on a long-term solution.
5.  If we don't reach a long-term solution, we would flip back to the terms 
of the existing contract, and are back to the existing issues.  
6.  We reinforced the highly confidential nature of these discussions.
Commercial terms
? Intent is to offer an intermediate solution to mediate UC/CSU's concern of 
potential long-term consequences (loss of direct access rights preventing 
them from gaining financial benefits) due to status as a bundled utility 
customer.  Want time for landscape to solidify so we can agree on a long term 
solution that would retain them as a direct access customer or a synthetic 
version of that (i.e., they still receive the benefits).
? Enron would re-DASR accounts, assuming the following:
? UC/CSU assume liabilities from February 1, 2001 through end of term of 
interim agreement, resulting from that action.
? Term to be 90 days, with the option to extend upon the mutual agreement of 
both parties.
? Calculation methodology of the liability:  Spot market price minus the 
prevailing bundled utility rate plus load shaping costs (Dennis - please 
provide the methodology.  Also, what about A/R risk, treatment of 
surcharges?).
? Exposure is calculated ex-post (i.e., we will not agree to an amount, 
capped or fixed, at the outset).  They want an estimation of the potential 
exposure, so we need to make sure we have proper protection that does not 
bind us to that estimation. (Alternatively, we can provide them this 
estimation outside the agreement, with the same caveats).
? Agree during interim period to work together (good faith effort) to 
mitigate the exposure of the liability.
? UC/CSU assumes risk that should we be barred from re-de-DASRing at the end 
of the term (due to legislative, regulatory or other actions or 
circumstances), UC/CSU would assume this exposure as well.  They countered 
with a suggestion for our consideration that such an occurrence be treated as 
a force majure event with the affect of terminating the contract.  (This 
seems counter-intuitive to me to their desire to remain a direct access 
customer - see concern below).
? This was not discussed, but term should include a provision for 
confidentiality.
Concern:
It is somewhat disconcerting they have asked for and are considering this 
proposal.  They are absorbing our risk, which we shared to be a very large 
number ($100M+ over the remaining contract term).  They also did not want to 
discuss their regulatory concerns, and enter into a discussion with Dasovich 
regarding these.  These points lead me to believe that perhaps they know 
something we don't.  Just a consideration for our call Saturday.

Subject: 

We had a cordial and outside the box discussion with UC/CSU today.

On the call, UC/CSU expressed a concern that in light of the uncertain and 
rapidly evolving regulatory and legislative landscape, they do not feel it to 
be prudent for them to consider our long-term proposed solutions.  They were 
intrigued by our offers and we will take them up at a later date.  In the 
meantime, they are proposing we price a short term deal.  This will buy them 
re-DASR status until the end of the current uncertain situation.

Proposed Structure:

Enron to temporarily Re-DASR UC/CSU accounts.  UC/CSU liable for any 
additional costs incurred by Enron as a result of that action.  Such costs 
may include, but not be limited to the following: account receivable risks, 
difference between spot market price and utility bundled rate, exposure to 
changes in calculation of PX credit applicable to direct access providers (as 
compared to spot market purchase price), load shaping costs to follow 
customer hourly load without availability of the PX.

Assumptions:

? Enron has sole option to return accounts to De-DASR status at end of term.
? UC/CSU assumes risk should this action be blocked by law, regulation, or 
3rd party action.
? Enron retains right in contract to choose source of electricity supply for 
duration of existing contract term.
? Enron will work with UC/CSU to mitigate liability exposure (i.e., consider 
entering into purchase agreement with utilities, etc.).

Potential liability during term (notional):  $_____ (60 day term);   $____(90 
day term)

Potential liability at end of term if Enron is unable to return accounts to 
utility supply status at end of term due to potential legislative, 
regulatory, or other action or circumstance (notional):   $_____ (assuming 60 
day term);   $____(assuming 90 day term)


It is envisioned that during this short term period that the regulatory and 
legislative landscape will become clearer, allowing both parties to better 
understand their exposure through the term of the contract and beyond.  Once 
this clarity is achieved, it is agreed both parties will meet to discuss long 
term solutions meeting the needs of both parties.

Please comment with concerns, ideas immediately as we will be back on the 
phone with them shortly.

Thank you.

Tom

Subject: Summary of 3.2.01 meeting to fix Direct Access prohibition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 03/04/2001 12:06 PM -----

A meeting with Sen. Bowne's staffer Lawrence Lingbloom took place on 3.2.01 
to discuss fixing the DA prohibition in AB1X.
About 30+ other interested parties attended.  
On 3.1.01 Bowen's office had distributed a complex proposal; and the meeting 
was convened to discuss the proposal.
The proposal distributed by Lingbloom was unacceptable and rejected but at 
least it acknowledged the need to allow some level of DA, i.e., moved away 
from a complete prohibition on DA.
After much discussion, Lingbloom left the meeting for a while, during which 
time the group engaged in a productive discussion with CDWR/CA Dept. of 
Finance.
The group asked DWR/Finance if they could agree to a program that: 
a) treats bond financing costs as a nonbypassable charge designed to cover 
the period during which the customer consumed power subsidized and purchased 
by DWR;

b) includes an exit fee for customers switching to DA if, and only if, there 
are actual costs associated with power contracts signed by DWR that might be 
"stranded";

c) permits an open season for "free switching" to DA when demand exceeds the 
sum of DWR's firm contract portfolio, retained generation and QF cost. This 
would mean that the amount of load covered by DWR's spot purchases, plus new 
load growth, should not face restrictions on Direct Access.

DWR wanted to include an agreement on information exchange, which might 
include noncore customers advising DWR in advance when they will switch to DA.
In return, DWR offered to post information about their power contracts and 
terms AFTER contracts were executed. 
Enron's outside attorney is drafting language to capture the concepts 
discussed at the 3.2.01 meeting.
The draft will be distributed and discussed on Monday, 3.5.01.

-- AB 60x (Hertzberg) is going to be amended before its hearing on Monday.
The original version would have required, as a condition of permitting a
powerplant, developers to offer to sell the power to California entities.
The new amendments do not appear to address IEP,s concerns with the measure
and may be even worse.  IEP is currently reviewing the following language
and is expected to maintain its opposition:

Section 25525.3 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission shall
require, as a condition of certification, that the applicant shall offer to
enter into a contract to sell to an electrical corporation as defined in
Section 218 of the Public Utilities Code, a municipal corporation as defined
in Section 9601 of the Public Utilities Code, or the Department of Water
Resources, electrical power generated by the facility as its initial and
continuing available capacity on terms not less favorable than the terms of
the next offer that the applicant makes for the sale of electrical power
generated by that facility.
(b) This section applies to applications filed prior to the effective date
of the act that added this section that have not been certified by the
commission prior to that date.
(c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commission
to delay the adoption of a final decision in any proceeding in which public
record has been closed and submitted for a final decision.
(d)  The commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the implementation
and enforcement of this section.

-- AB 8x (Migden), which would give the EOB additional and undefined powers
related to the coordination of operation and maintenance schedules, passed
the Assembly Appropriations committee.  As a follow-up to the policy
committee hearing, IEP submitted comments and amendments to the author,s
office.  Before any changes to the bill are made, Migden,s office has
indicated their preference for a larger stakeholder meeting to address these
and others concerns, which is unlikely to occur before the bill passes off
the Assembly floor next week.  IEP,s primary interest is getting changes to
the bill that it can live with before it reaches the Senate policy
committee.

-- SB 39x (Speier), which would define generators as public utilities and
put the CPUC in the role of coordinating outages and maintenance schedules,
passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee with little change.  One
of the amendments taken would clarify that only owners of the divested
plants would be subject to the provisions in the bill.  Several generators
met with Speier this week to plead their case with little affect.  The
measure will go to the Senate floor next and is expected to pass.  Where
this measure will find difficulties is in the Assembly, which will have
already passed out AB 8x (Migden), which accomplishes the same goals as SB
39x.  Chances are that the Assembly ECA committee would hold SB 39x in
deference to the committee,s position on AB 8x.  The same could be said for
AB 8x on the Senate side, but AB 8x came from the Administration which may
give it more weight to move it forward.

-- The Senate Energy Committee heard SB 47x (Battin), which lowers the
payments of the purchase power agreements between the QFs and the IOUs, but
did not vote on the measure.  Senator Bowen, Chair of the committee, was
intent on discussing selected provisions of the bill and their relationship
to public policy objectives before she felt comfortable taking a vote.  She
indicated a desire to continue discussions with stakeholders to address and
clarify issues and concerns in the bill, and bring it up for another hearing
and vote most likely next Tuesday.  IEP continues to seek support for the
measure and add co-authors.

-- The Senate Energy Committee also heard SB 28x (Sher/Battin), which makes
various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored
proposals.  So far this is the most comprehensive and positive siting bill
introduced, with the greatest chance of moving forward.  The bill passed out
of the committee on a 9 to 0 vote even though most of the environmental
community testified in opposition.  Chris Ellison and I are continuing to
work with the authors, staff to develop additional language which should be
available before the measure goes to the Assembly.  Senator Bowen, however,
has indicated she will bring it back to her committee for another hearing if
there are any significant changes, slowing the bill,s progress.

-- AB 36x (Wright), which would apply specified repower projects to the
6-month expedited siting process established in AB 970 (2000), passed out of
the Assembly Appropriations Committee.  IEP testified in support of the
bill, still noting we were still working with the author on language.  IEP
continues to believe that with the current language, few, if any, projects
would qualify and is working with staff on fixing that.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
of any of these bills.

Subject: SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS; Davis Staff Admit that DWR Costs for
 Purchases Is Staggering and Rates Must Increase Dramatically; PG&E says it
 will sue over QF payment plan; Mike Kahn Takes Pot Shots in Editorial
 Defending Davis/Lynch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly 
slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of 
the following events.  In sum:

Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met 
with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom.  
DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 
100%.  (See attached story.)
Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because 
Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, "don't move 8X (a bill that 
Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; 
they need much more." 
It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis 
likes it or not.
The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had 
been informed of the "bombshell." 
Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the 
situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.)
Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they 
won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to 
implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.)
Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in 
which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market 
proponents, price gougers and Texans, and defending Davis and Lynch.

Davis' Measured Plan To Fight the Darkness

D103778.DTL 
COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov. 
Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to 
light a candle than curse the darkness. 
Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme. 
The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed. 
-- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission? 
-- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could 
charge customers? 
-- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to 
sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory 
pricing by out-of-state merchant generators? 
-- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to 
ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity? 
-- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough 
available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and 
demand? 
These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents 
of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to 
bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions. 
The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid, 
though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning 
electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of 
power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason 
Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern 
California had plenty of power. 
The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities, 
pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a 
tangible and valuable asset in exchange. 
And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing 
bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long 
failed at doing. 
The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and 
Davis' actions to enhance these efforts. 
California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The 
governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an 
executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their 
consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial 
lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and 
commercial buildings more energy efficient. 
The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend 
that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance 
in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has 
licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is 
part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an 
additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50 
percent increase in generation. 
And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right 
sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a 
strong bent toward renewable power sources. 
In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the 
bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the 
effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable 
power sources. 
Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by 
former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta 
Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to 
deal effectively with the energy emergency. 
Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC 
commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their 
appointments. 
Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was 
Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise 
in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president. 
Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to 
buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange. 
This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy 
price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling 
additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make 
California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power 
grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it. 
Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill 
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear 
plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty 
Texas- style power plants in California. 
Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California. 
Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new 
nuclear plants. 
And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a 
Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants. 
Most disingenuously, the apologists would "let the market work," claiming 
that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But 
the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators 
overcharged the state in January. 
Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp 
down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's 
deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market 
forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest 
prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported 
that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since 
1999. 
Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well 
that if the market "works" to produce New York-style rate increases in 
California, the consequences to the public would be dire. 
Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy 
conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his 
expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly. 
Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics' 
perspective.

Bombshell Warning on Power Cost 
Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature

N176940.DTL 
Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state 
may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the 
next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent. 
The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated 
promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without 
a rate increase. 
California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity 
buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to 
keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back 
on their feet. 
Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would 
have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion. 
But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm. 
"There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the 
negotiations, this can be added up any way you want," said Steve Maviglio, 
press secretary to Davis. 
"Those numbers are not based on any reality right now," he said. "There are 
too many things up in the air." 
Assembly Democrats told a different story. 
They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet 
Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with 
Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell. 
And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow 
lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration. 
They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the 
day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the 
figures. 
PURCHASES IN BILLIONS
The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the 
state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An 
additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year, 
they said. 
The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17 
because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases. 
From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power 
purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the 
amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills. 
Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10 
billion without raising rates. 
But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty 
rate increase would be necessary. 
INCREASE UPON INCREASE
The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a 
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled 
for no later than March 2002. 
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent 
increase would be required to cover the debt service. 
"For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is 
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been 
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the 
reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek 
(Santa Cruz County). 
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them 
out. 
And it could mean political trouble for Davis. 
"Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's 
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002," 
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to 
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. 
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power 
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot 
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as 
rolling blackouts spread across the state. 
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers 
will resume debate Monday. 
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment 
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has 
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. 
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing 
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern 
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators 
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. 
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the 
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. 
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's 
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in 
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds 
$1. 4 billion a month. 
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their 
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. 
"It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They 
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way." 
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to 
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to 
provide energy. 
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The 
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as 
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid 
pennies on the dollar. 
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the 
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so 
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. 
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries 
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost 
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes 
Critics say he should have been at Capitol

N171337.DTL 
While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping 
hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended 
a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert. 
Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare 
Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private 
country club of which Dauner is a member. 
Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped 
by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento. 
But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small 
power generators -- languished in the Assembly. 
On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to 
Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues. 
"There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief 
critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to 
try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass 
in Palm Springs." 
The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends 
raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled 
interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration. 
Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 -- 
averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund- 
raisers directed at specific industries. 
Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to 
dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch" 
preceding the golf. 
South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying 
amounts of money." 
Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues 
important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression 
that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state 
Sen. 
Don Perata, D-Oakland. 
Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad, 
Perata said. 
"We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their 
confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us 
reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted." 
Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the 
problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad. 
"It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the 
benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. 
Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about 
the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the 
state. He appeared live from Palm Springs. 
The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and 
boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through 
both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts." 
Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing 
education and streamline college requirements for nurses. 
One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes. 
The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which 
is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late 
bills owed to hospitals. 
Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction 
health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on 
time. 
In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at 
Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree 
that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year. 
At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at 
those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social 
event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing 
education than anything else." 
Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 23, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PG&E Responds to Energy Proposals in Sacramento 
	San Francisco -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced that it 
will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the State of 
California to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure. The proposed 
actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the 
entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy 
crisis at risk. 
	This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying 
Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1, 
and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any 
other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral 
contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO). 
	"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. "The numbers just don't work." 
	Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been 
collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric 
power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including 
power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of 
operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to 
the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources 
exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months. 
Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by 
the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open 
position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This 
dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional 
liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
	"We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive, 
comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly 
priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers, 
lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must 
challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is 
collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded.

Defending Davis/Lynch

Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly 
slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of 
the following events.  In sum:

Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met 
with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom.  
DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 
100%.  (See attached story.)
Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because 
Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, "don't move 8X (a bill that 
Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; 
they need much more." 
It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis 
likes it or not.
The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had 
been informed of the "bombshell." 
Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the 
situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.)
Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they 
won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to 
implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.)
Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in 
which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market 
proponents, price gougers and Texans, and defending Davis and Lynch.

Davis' Measured Plan To Fight the Darkness

D103778.DTL 
COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov. 
Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to 
light a candle than curse the darkness. 
Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme. 
The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed. 
-- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission? 
-- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could 
charge customers? 
-- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to 
sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory 
pricing by out-of-state merchant generators? 
-- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to 
ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity? 
-- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough 
available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and 
demand? 
These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents 
of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to 
bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions. 
The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid, 
though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning 
electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of 
power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason 
Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern 
California had plenty of power. 
The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities, 
pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a 
tangible and valuable asset in exchange. 
And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing 
bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long 
failed at doing. 
The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and 
Davis' actions to enhance these efforts. 
California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The 
governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an 
executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their 
consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial 
lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and 
commercial buildings more energy efficient. 
The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend 
that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance 
in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has 
licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is 
part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an 
additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50 
percent increase in generation. 
And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right 
sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a 
strong bent toward renewable power sources. 
In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the 
bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the 
effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable 
power sources. 
Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by 
former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta 
Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to 
deal effectively with the energy emergency. 
Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC 
commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their 
appointments. 
Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was 
Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise 
in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president. 
Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to 
buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange. 
This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy 
price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling 
additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make 
California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power 
grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it. 
Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill 
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear 
plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty 
Texas- style power plants in California. 
Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California. 
Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new 
nuclear plants. 
And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a 
Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants. 
Most disingenuously, the apologists would "let the market work," claiming 
that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But 
the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators 
overcharged the state in January. 
Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp 
down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's 
deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market 
forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest 
prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported 
that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since 
1999. 
Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well 
that if the market "works" to produce New York-style rate increases in 
California, the consequences to the public would be dire. 
Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy 
conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his 
expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly. 
Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics' 
perspective. 
Michael Kahn is a member of the state Independent System Operator's board of 
governors.

Bombshell Warning on Power Cost 
Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature

N176940.DTL 
Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state 
may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the 
next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent. 
The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated 
promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without 
a rate increase. 
California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity 
buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to 
keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back 
on their feet. 
Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would 
have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion. 
But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm. 
"There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the 
negotiations, this can be added up any way you want," said Steve Maviglio, 
press secretary to Davis. 
"Those numbers are not based on any reality right now," he said. "There are 
too many things up in the air." 
Assembly Democrats told a different story. 
They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet 
Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with 
Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell. 
And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow 
lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration. 
They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the 
day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the 
figures. 
PURCHASES IN BILLIONS
The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the 
state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An 
additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year, 
they said. 
The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17 
because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases. 
From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power 
purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the 
amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills. 
Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10 
billion without raising rates. 
But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty 
rate increase would be necessary. 
INCREASE UPON INCREASE
The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a 
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled 
for no later than March 2002. 
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent 
increase would be required to cover the debt service. 
"For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is 
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been 
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the 
reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek 
(Santa Cruz County). 
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them 
out. 
And it could mean political trouble for Davis. 
"Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's 
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002," 
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to 
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. 
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power 
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot 
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as 
rolling blackouts spread across the state. 
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers 
will resume debate Monday. 
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment 
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has 
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. 
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing 
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern 
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators 
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. 
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the 
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. 
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's 
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in 
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds 
$1. 4 billion a month. 
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their 
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. 
"It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They 
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way." 
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to 
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to 
provide energy. 
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The 
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as 
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid 
pennies on the dollar. 
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the 
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so 
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. 
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries 
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost 
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes 
Critics say he should have been at Capitol

While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping 
hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended 
a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert. 
Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare 
Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private 
country club of which Dauner is a member. 
Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped 
by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento. 
But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small 
power generators -- languished in the Assembly. 
On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to 
Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues. 
"There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief 
critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to 
try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass 
in Palm Springs." 
The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends 
raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled 
interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration. 
Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 -- 
averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund- 
raisers directed at specific industries. 
Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to 
dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch" 
preceding the golf. 
South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying 
amounts of money." 
Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues 
important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression 
that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state 
Sen. 
Don Perata, D-Oakland. 
Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad, 
Perata said. 
"We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their 
confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us 
reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted." 
Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the 
problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad. 
"It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the 
benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. 
Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about 
the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the 
state. He appeared live from Palm Springs. 
The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and 
boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through 
both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts." 
Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing 
education and streamline college requirements for nurses. 
One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes. 
The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which 
is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late 
bills owed to hospitals. 
Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction 
health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on 
time. 
In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at 
Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree 
that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year. 
At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at 
those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social 
event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing 
education than anything else." 
Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

PG&E Responds to Energy Proposals in Sacramento 
	San Francisco -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced that it 
will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the State of 
California to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure. The proposed 
actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the 
entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy 
crisis at risk. 
	This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying 
Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1, 
and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any 
other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral 
contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO). 
	"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. "The numbers just don't work." 
	Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been 
collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric 
power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including 
power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of 
operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to 
the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources 
exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months. 
Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by 
the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open 
position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This 
dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional 
liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
	"We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive, 
comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly 
priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers, 
lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must 
challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is 
collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded.

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook 
Davis favors tiered rate increases

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money," said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. "We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, "were wildly high." 
"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
" Maviglio said. "Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything." 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall," 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. "Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large." 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
"I don't like either choice," said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. "But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts." 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within "the existing rate structure" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
"For the good of California, it's inevitable," said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
"It's like gasoline," he said. "I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business." 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it," said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. "But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts." 
"I'd rather have blackouts," agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. "I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher." 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation," said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
"It adjusts consumer behavior," Higgins said. "People want to get their bills 
back down." 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this," 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals," said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "We 
need to get back to a regulated system." 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
"We've paid too much already," Rosenfield said. "A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease." 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
"Big users should pay more," he said after a moment's reflection. "I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair." 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," she said. "People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more." 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. "That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability," she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

Hi Avrim:

So sorry this took me so long, and I hope you haven't already left---I recall 
you saying that you guys were leaving on the 1st, which I hope is the case.  
Anyway, hope that this finds you before you depart.

First, if you didn't buy a "Plan du Paris" ("map of Paris, in English) on 
your first trip, I highly recommend it. All Parisians use it, it costs about 
$10-15 and you'll use if for all your other trips to Paris.  It's a must for 
getting around the town.  Every street in the city; all the 
"arrondissements": map of the subway system, etc.

OK, here goes.  It's been a while, and I don't have my "Plan" with me here in 
Mexico, so I'm working from memory.  Hope that it's helpful.  Once you've 
bought your "Plan," you can reference my suggestions and get yourself 
oriented, link the walks together, etc.

For an exotic (and cool) experience, go to "the Mosque" ("La Mosquee") in 
French.  It's in the southeastern part of the city (15th arrondissement, or 
5th?).  Go the cafe in the mosque and have tea.  It's just very cool.
La Rue Moufftard (sp?).  It starts on the top of the hill where the Pantheon 
is (across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens).  It's a neat little 
street that winds down the other side of the hill.  Go before noon when the 
market fills the street---you can buy a few things and picnic in the 
Luxembourg Garden.
Speaking of the Luxembourg Gardens, it's a neat place.  I'd take a walk 
through---check out all of the "espaille'd" fruit trees----truly a work of 
art.
Walk to the other side of the Garden (opposite from the Pantheon side) and 
find the "St. Sulpice" church.  Very cool neighborhood (St. Germain des Pres 
neighborhood).  The church is on a square; there's a lot of very nice cafes 
and restaurants, and it's the site of the famous "Left Bank" fashion center.
While you're over there, wander to the Montparnasse neighborhood and stop in 
at the "Rosebud" bar.  Hemmingway and the gang drank there.  It's small, the 
waiters where little white coats and they play real vinyl records of the best 
jazz anywhere.  Best of all, it's not pretentious.  It's hip.
Also there is a cemetery where many famous folks are buried (including Serge 
Gainsbourg)----cemeteries are of course a big deal in Paris, the most notable 
being the Pere LaChaise Cemetery, where Jim Morrison is buried. They're 
Interesting enough, but I don't know if I'd go out of my way....
In the Latin Quarter (5th arrond), check out "L'Ecluse," right on the river 
at the Quai les Grands Augustins, just off Boulevard St. Michel.  Little wine 
bar with tasty things to nibble on.  Great place to take a breather in the 
late afternoon (somewhat) in style.
The Picasso museum in the &Marais8 neighborhood is an absolute must.  And 
while you,re there be sure to cruise the neighborhood.  Very gentrified these 
days (and it,s the gay neighborhood), but been renovated into a lot of very 
impressive art galleries and fashion houses---very neat.
While there (in the same neighborhood) go to the &Place des Vosges.8  Unreal 
big old square from way back when---great to look at and there,s shops and 
cafes.
The &Institute du Monde Arab8 is on the Mitterand,s &seven great projects.8  
Architechturally magnificent and the exhibits inside are modest and very 
impressive.
Rue de la Roquette is now extremely hip---on the east side of the Bastille 
behind the &new opera8 (if you get a chance go an opera there---very populist 
experience and fun.  Roquette is where the clubs and the musique are.  
General hip-dome (and if you,re inclined to do some real people-watching, go 
to Boulevard St. Germain and sit outside at Les Deux Magots or Caf, Fleure 
and watch away).
Find on your map the church St. Eustache.  Walk around east of it for some 
very cool neighborhood viewing*used to be big wholesale butchers and such 
(extension of Les Halles, which is now a big shopping mall but used to be 
Paris, outdoor market).  From there walk to &Place des Victoires, or Place 
des Notre Dame des Victoires (I can,t remember).  And look for Gallerie 
Vivienne, too---Belle Epoque little food a shopping corrider*very neat.
And finally, while your over there, go to the Palais Royale (by the Louvre), 
which is where Louis XIV grew up as a boy---fantastic courtyard, 
controversial artwork (black and white striped columns);  walk to the 
opposite end, exit the courtyard out the back and continue walking in the 
neighborhood.

I,ll leave the museums, etc. to you.  Sorry to quick and dirty.  Have a great 
time.  See you soon.

Best,
Jeff

Isle St. Louis (the island right across from Isle de la Cite--where Notre

Brasserie Isle St. Louis, where you can get a beer and a glass of wine and 
get in on some great local color.  Stroll down the main street on the island, 
Isle St. Louis en L'Isle," and right off the street get a scoop of ice cream 
from "Bertillion," the renowned ice-creamery in Paris.
You can spend a very nice day at the Rodin museum.  Breathtaking.
Sacre Coeur is good for the neighborhood more than for Sacre Coeur, but worth 
going to.  Check out the artwork and roam around for a nice local bar on the 
hill.
Polly Magoo on Rue St. Jacque (by Shakespeare & Co.) is where Mick Jagger 
hangs out (if you're interested).
Monet's water lilies in the basement of "l'Orangerie" is fairly moving (at 
the east end of Tuilleries Gardens--east of the Louvre.

ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION 
TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Locker today released the following 
statement regarding Pacific Gas & Electric's decision to file for bankruptcy:

"The uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers 
has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of California's oldest 
businesses. While this is a significant and unwelcome development, our team 
of bankruptcy litigators has been
preparing for several months to defend California taxpayers in the event of a 
utility bankruptcy. This morning, I spoke with a PG&E executive, and he 
personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay 
the state for its purchase of energy and
to repay its renewable energy supplier-creditors ("qualified facilities"). I 
am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent 
necessary. Over the last several months, our state attorneys have fought hard 
in the courts to ensure that out-of-state
generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies 
to Californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state's 
two major utilities. The health and safety of Californians and the future of 
our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy 
business decisions of generators, marketers and utilities. Justice requires 
that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of 
Californians must pay back what they owe. I will use all the considerable 
resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the 
bills affordable for every California home and business, to recover 
California tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly 
taken, and to punish wrongdoers."

AWARD TO INFORMANTS

"It is possible that one or more members of the public can help with 
information, and if so, the financial reward to such a person or persons 
could be enormous. My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into 
whether energy providers have violated any laws. Over the last four years, 
state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state 
and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas. Under 
California false claims law, any person or corporation who obtains state 
taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties 
that can be as high as three times the actual losses. And anyone who provides 
information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may 
be entitled to a percentage share in that award. Since billions of state 
dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant could potentially range 
from $50 million to the
hundreds of millions of dollars. I am asking any member of the public with 
personal knowledge of any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction 
in the California supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or 
electricity to contact my office immediately by calling: 1-800-952-5225 (w/in 
CA) or (916) 322-3360 (local or out of state), or e-mail the Attorney 
General's Energy Emergency Task Force at energywhistleblower@doj.ca.gov."

Dudes:
Here's my my comments to Mark's answers to the questions, and suggestions to 
Jimmie's model.  I don't answer the bottom line question, since we have some 
talking to do on the model.  

Jimmie, your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow 
(as opposed to NI).  I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow 
model.  All my stuff is highlighted in yellow.  

It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions).  I get at 
25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions.  

I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor 
those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.  Others agree?  

Anyway, it gives me a $3.32 share value, so I think the model's got some 
work.  Take a look and let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Re: Netscape
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guess I was lazier still.  Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to 
recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash 
flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.  31% and 40% growth rates are (I 
would argue) wildly unrealistic.  In addition, the capex numbers would 
(presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there.  
Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 
price (though "irrational exuberance" may permit Netscape to pull it off).  
Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for 
the memo.  Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.  Great job on the 
case.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
You're obviously right about discounting cash flow.  I was getting a little 
lazy.  The capital exp in Exhibit 3 in the book is close to what you have in 
the model.  I agree about your working capital assumption.  I guess I'm not 
clear on your conclusion. The $3+ you calculated a share is based on 16% 
growth.  We are being asked to calculate what growth justifies $28/share.  I 
calculate 31% growth for $14/share and about 40% growth for $28 per share.  
Reality is their immediate growth is probably going to be higher than both 
numbers but would not be sustainable for 10 years.

Anyway while we bat this around, I've begun putting some bullshit into the 
memo.  I guess I vote we double the price.  The other IPO in Exhibit 6 
(especially Uunet) demonstrate how hot the high tech IPO market is.  IPOs are 
a lot about emotion and maybe a little about cash flow.  What's the down side 
if the offering doesn't sell well.  Netscape has a very hot business they 
should extract a high price for the potential gold mind they offer (this is 
my 1999 thinking, not 2000).  Comments?

Jimmy

OK Gang:

Well, I,ve been crunching numbers all day, and haven,t yet gotten to the 
writing.  I've attached Dylan's original responses for reference.  Figure 
it'll be a memo from Time's CEO to the Time Board.

I,ve leaving now for Mendocino, but will be back early tomorrow to finish 
this up.  Please check out the spreadsheet.

The case is sort of confusing*how do Time,s analysts value Time at $189-212, 
when they,re trading at 109 the day before the announcement of the deal with 
Warner.  That doesn,t jive.  Are they saying that, absent synergies, the 
combined Time/Warner is worth the enterprise value of Time at 189-212 plus 
the enterprise value of Warner at $63-71 (again, the analysts valuation)?  
That just seems ridiculous, give where they,re trading.

Anyway, here,s where my analysis is heading----tell me if I,m smoking crack.

The deal isn,t really $175 per share.  It,s $175 LESS the taxes that will 
have to paid (since it,s a purchase deal) PLUS the value of the tax shield 
created by the net increase of $8.9B in new debt that Paramount will take 
on.  Does this seem right?  Could folks look at my spreadsheet?  I,ve got it 
conceptually set up, but I,m not quite sure how to calculate the taxes paid 
under the purchase method or the value of the tax shield (assuming that this 
is correct.  If I,m just completely out of it with this angle, just let me 
know.  In any case, seems that there,s some value in the tax-free 
(Time-Warner) versus the taxable (Time-Paramount) deals.  Presumably, we 
could take the total enterprise value of Time-Warner (nontaxed) and compared 
it to the total enterprise of Paramount-Time (taxed) and compare the two.  I,
ve got a hunch that the Time-Warner number may win the day, but I haven,t 
gotten that far in the crunching yet.

In any case, I,ll be back around Noon tomorrow and will crank the puppy out.

Best,
Jeff

The following are summaries of today's appearance by Sen. John Burton to the Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against FERC.
 
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at a lunch with the Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about the Edison MOU, which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review, the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the Natural Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.  (One columnist commented that Burton would "love it to death," meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
 
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC.  He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate.
 
Burton is obviously troubled by the MOU; he said "some people" say it doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.  He said the following would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable:
 
Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% "haircut";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay back debt.
 
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said "no" and that he feels the parent should pay "a ton."  That led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component, which he doesn't like. He used the example that if electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is $5, if prices drop to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.  A larger infusion of cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component. 
 
Burton called the dedicated rate component a "big problem" and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign.
 
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more (note:  this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media).  He later threw out the number $200.  The state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar, he said, so this is one way he sees to fight back.  It's tough medicine, but as he put it, "You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy, but two days later you're over it and your stomach's OK."
 
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how he believe the situation should be handled:  "The only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards."
 
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU, Burton said the MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December.
 
 
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
 
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.  If additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
 
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the Senate; Bob Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City of Oakland.  At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty. Clark Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.  
 
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling within 21 days.
 
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.  Hertzberg added that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for Californians' relief.
 
Joe Cotchett said the suit is "very basic" and is based on the Federal Power Act, which he says limits power costs to "fair and justifiable" rates.  A primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a "health and welfare" and public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million disabled children and 12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts.  He said it is "not an economic lawsuit -- it's about senior citizens, disabled kids and convalescent facilities."  Today also happened to be the legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities (the nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
 
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were opportunities to exert market power.  He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility (obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant off-line and substituting higher rates.  He said, however, that this order had been sealed.
 
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of blackouts this summer, which could mean four hours a day.  That could be, he said, "potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration."  Cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from blackouts, which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities.
 
Jerry Brown added that "prices are unjust and people are suffering."  Continued high prices could mean "potential civic disruption," and that there will be "more actions to mobilize" Western mayors.
 
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit.
 
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV here as a legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his Press Club appearance.  He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit. Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team.
 
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three years, and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably.  It has failed to define "fair and justifiable"; that failure, he said, violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution.
 
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon "fellow Republicans" to support the effort.
 
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California, the president and FERC would have acted long ago.
 
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because "5 generators supply 90%" of the electricity in CA and all five have rate renewals before FERC.  He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal Protection clause.  He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs:  Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota and one other he didn't name.  None of these states has yet committed to joining the suit.

Subject:	Recipient of the first Kent Wheatland Memorial Award
Sue Mara of Enron has been named the first recipient of the Kent
Wheatland Memorial Award.  Sue was selected in consultation with many of
WPTF's Board members because of her tenacity, forth-rightness, and
courage.  She will be bestowed the honor on the evening of June 21 at
our General Meeting in Ojai, and presenting the award to Sue will be
Kent's brother, Gregg.

Please join me in congratulating Sue on her selection.  You will note
that she is not copied on this memo, but I called her this morning to
tell her the news.  She was shocked, and honored, and almost, but not
quite speechless.

Please don't use this yet.  Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if marked to market today).  Jim's got it , too.

Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.  Will give you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

June 22, 2001


The Honorable Joseph Dunn
Chair, Senate Select Committee
California State Senate
Room 2080
California State Capitol
Sacramento, CA 95814

Dear Senator Dunn:

Earlier this year, you met individually with IEP and various other parties to explain the purpose of the Senate Select Committee?s hearing and the process under which they were to be conducted.  You made it very clear that you were planning to have fact-finding hearings based upon fundamental fairness and due process.  You made a further commitment that there would be no surprises.  Prior to today, the hearings have been conducted consistent with that representation.

Unfortunately, today it appears that the Committee has set a new course that radically departs from these previous commitments.  Today, the Committee is hearing testimony from several surprise witnesses.  These witnesses are former employees of San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) under contract with Duke Energy for an interim period during which Duke Energy operated the facilities in San Diego.   It is our understanding that these former contract employees are alleging that the company failed to properly maintain these facilities, and they are alleging that Duke Energy cycled these facilities differently than the former owner, SDG&E.  It is also our understanding that Duke Energy will not be afforded the opportunity to contemporaneously challenge these allegations and/or provide an explanation as to the operational behavior of the facilities.  In short, the hearings are being reduced to a media event, giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of disgruntled ex-employees.

Respectfully, it would appear that the Committee has wandered far afield of its stated goals.  These hearings have the potential of identifying what went wrong with California?s energy policy and how to fix it.  However, this will only occur if this inquiry is based on informal facts and complete information, not innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations.  It is the pursuit of facts, not headlines, which will solve California?s energy crisis.  These facts will be revealed only in a fair process, where allegations made are subject to contemporaneous response.  

It is our hope that today?s process is an aberration, and not a departure from your commitments.  The Committee is at a crossroads.  It can choose to engage in fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch-hunt in pursuit of headlines.  For the benefit of all Californian?s, the Committee should focus on fact-finding and analysis.

Sincerely,



Jan Smutny-Jones
Executive Director

Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis 
Energy advisers have ruthless reputation

No matter how much you try to spin the facts, the truth usually topples out. 
This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout, 
because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader, who, quite 
equitably, is suffering his own power crisis. 
Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting black-and-white 
problem. How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy 
crisis sooner, his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and 
power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response 
to spend $40 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without 
offering consumers the details of the pact? 
The truth is, he cannot, although he has tried mightily. And to that end he 
made one of his biggest mistakes yet -- no small feat when you consider he is 
at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in California's 
history. 
Rather than tackle the issues head-on, Davis did what he has always done: use 
consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public 
opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his 
problems. It's a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a 
mere weekend hobbyist. 
Davis' decision to hire two former Clinton-Gore spin doctors to explain away 
his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat 
of rolling blackouts. If only, in this case, he could have kept his critics 
in the dark. 
While the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills, Davis was 
pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might 
conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power 
suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers 
dry. 
It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help 
the nation's most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November. 
And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were 
being Snopes-like in their dealings with the Golden State. 
But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated 
California's energy plight through his own inaction -- as evidenced by our 
sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and 
spiraling electricity costs early last summer. 
Yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them? 
When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis' popularity ratings 
began short-circuiting, he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, who had 
been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden Clinton administration as the stain 
on a certain intern's dress. 
The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the 
press each day that they earned the label "masters of disaster" -- which may 
be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to 
envelop him. If only he had considered the accompanying stink. 
Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing 
less than ruthless, partisan hired guns, happy to attack anyone standing 
between them and a monthly paycheck. 
Unfortunately for Davis, the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by 
California taxpayers, who are none too happy that they will be socked with 
billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis' lack of 
leadership. 
So although Lehane and Fabiani's $30,000 monthly consulting fees may look 
paltry to a governor who has contributed to California's lost billions, it 
looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats, 
sometimes known as California's 30 million-plus residents. 
The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from 
Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political 
Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California 
Edison as consultants -- a generally accepted no-no for public officials, 
even those who worked in Washington. 
And State Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat, has rightfully 
refused to pay state funds for the Clinton-Gore castoffs, because she said it 
is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy -- not politics 
- - as required by law. 
Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of 
ethics, it's fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground. Or as one member 
of a tax protest group put it: "We are adding insult to injury to have the 
governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough 
for damage control." 
Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage, but right now Davis is 
a metal helmet in an electrical storm. His arrogant treatment of state 
voters, his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his 
way out of trouble has left even die-hard Democrats searching for a more 
palatable replacement. 
That decision will come next year when Davis is up for re-election. And the 
millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice 
will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas. 
Since the governor is involved, it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale. 
But by the time the spin doctors are through, it may start to sound more like 
an urban legend.

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Subject: PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

Technical Working Group	



Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.


Thanks,
Delaney

Campaign funds will pay for spots 
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week 
defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political 
campaigning has become a permanent sport. 
Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an 
"information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. 
But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed 
by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. 
"The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with 
the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots 
running since June 19. 
Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the 
governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, 
including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best 
way to fight back against high energy prices." 
Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex 
Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads 
don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is 
paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using 
state money to finance his political ambitions. 
South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads 
that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually 
going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as 
ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. 
"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is 
that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and 
some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am 
mood." 
Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan 
nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said 
the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. 
"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public 
service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they 
may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think 
he has any credibility on this issue." 
Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, 
which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis 
standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The 
West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. 
"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," 
said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President 
Bush in 2004. 
Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy 
companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis 
and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." 
Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had 
contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as 
Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." 
Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has 
contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the 
American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the 
ads running in California through July. 
Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential 
bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for 
the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a 
call for comment yesterday. 
Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are 
worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and 
Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. 
But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. 
Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull 
dramatically increased. 
Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin 
running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy 
supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. 
The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed 
Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for 
Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. 
Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- 
oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as 
the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between 
supply and demand, except through strict conservation. 
"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so 
far," Gillespie said.

Subject: Weekend efforts to translate core/noncore proposal into legislative
 language
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to 
attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the 
individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments 
provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new 
draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB 
tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain 
portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee 
to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service 
the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link 
the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought 
initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation 
stand.

Jeff

Subject: Weekend efforts to translate core/noncore proposal into legislative
 language
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.

Best,
Jeff

Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's not creating undue headaches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

Best,
Jeff

BN  18:06 Talks Between California, Generators End; No Accord (Correct)

(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to

result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph

and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)

 

     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two

weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power

sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states

recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold

hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.

     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two

sides no closer to an accord.

     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,
FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far

apart.''

      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because

the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are

also requesting money.

     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California

during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of

calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks

offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from

generators to $716 million.

      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how

the state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by

California's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said

Wagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should

be paid.

     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and

should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price

caps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest

priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.

      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,

Wagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a

refund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from

that time period.

     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's

recommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would

give his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and

California will sue to get the rest, he said.

     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without

releasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.

     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,

though they agreed the state asked for too much.

    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to

justify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because

we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in

question,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of

the power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows

how ridiculous this is.''

    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund

$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.

     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a

settlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting

blame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''

     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's

recommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general

counsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes

problems with California's methodology for calculating the

refunds, he said.

      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14

billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when

the state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The

state began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and

has spent close to $8 billion.

No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

Best,
Jeff

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language
that was added at the end of the first sentence and not replace it
unless we can get a clearer statement from Jeff of what he means.
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer? Barbara

The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour

Subject: California Assembly Releases "Modified MOU" for Edison
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Dow Jones--PUC to Raise Rates Another 25% to Cover DWR Contracts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Calif DWR Seen Asking PUC To Order 25% Rate Increase Fri
By Jason Leopold

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
(This article was originally published earlier Friday.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the
agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three
investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that
they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.

This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream
to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public
Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.

PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday
either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's
current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office
said.

If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate
structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the
rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power
buying business.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners
said.
"Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be
forced to do it again by the summer," one commissioner said.

"It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone. The state has
made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever
it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds."

Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late
Thursday.

Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has
drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or
Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to
finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts,
aides in his office said.
Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use
the least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides
said.

Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State

The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion
annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to
generate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the
commissioners said.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners
said.
Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity
on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern
California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.

The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which
must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.

In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term
power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure
there is enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance the
contracts are likely, state officials have said.

But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the
utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.
Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions
that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion
in revenue bonds to be sold.

The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state
Treasurer Phil Angelides.

The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate
hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to
terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since
last year.

After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of
California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down
Monday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. Gray
Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.

Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which
could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve
Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.

An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds
to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the
generators than what he thinks the state is owed.

California Power-Price Boost Not Needed, Agency Says (Update1)
By Daniel Taub


Sacramento, California, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California regulators won't need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf of the state's utilities. 

The California Department of Water Resources, which has spent more than $7.7 billion on power this year, is expected to recommend a rate increase of as much as 25 percent, Dow Jones reported today, citing three unnamed members of the state's Public Utilities Commission. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the agency, said no rate increase is expected. 

``Our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what our numbers show,'' Hidalgo said. ``In fact our numbers show that there is no need for any increase beyond what's already been done.'' 

The Department of Water Resources will submit a report to the California Public Utilities Commission today or Monday with the state's revenue requirements for repaying a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, Hidalgo said. The bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by PG&E Corp., Edison International and Sempra Energy. 

The bond sales, the largest municipal offering in U.S. history, are scheduled to begin in September. Governor Gray Davis has said repeatedly that he believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases. His position hasn't changed, spokesman Steve Maviglio said today. 

Previous Increases 

In March, the PUC voted to boost rates by 3 cents a kilowatt- hour at the state's two largest utilities. Rates at PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest California utility, would rise by as much as 36 percent and Southern California Edison rates would rise by as much as 27 percent, the PUC said at the time. 

The average consumer-price increase would be 30 percent, the PUC said. The increase, the second this year, was intended to help the state pay for power purchases. The PUC voted in January to raise rates about 10 percent. 

California Treasurer Philip Angelides has said that the bonds will let the state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by spreading power costs over time. The debt will be repaid over 15 years. 

Investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt. 

Legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment. That pledge, typical for revenue bonds, usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an added cushion. 

That formula, known as a debt service coverage ratio, must result in investment-grade ratings for California's power bonds, according to the legislation. Investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to maintain the promised cushion, even if increases aren't needed at the time of the bond sale.

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Sacramento is one goofy place.

Subject: California Update 07.18.01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Harry, Jeff, & Sue --

I keep getting these notes from Jeanne on different matters.

1. Is there any way to get Jeanne to start using non-CPUC terms to define the 
dockets (e.g., SCE PE Advice process)?  I have a very difficult time trying 
to figure out what material is being discussed.

2. I would like to have meeting to establish our priorities and leadership 
roles for the CPUC going forward.  Not sure how our decisionmaking is taking 
place.  I know that Harry has been taking a lot of the lead on these matters, 
but want to make sure that from a personnel focus we are doing our best.

I'll ask Linda Noske to set up a call for this Thursday am.

Thanks,

Jim

As part of its Memorandum of Understanding with DWR, SDG&E has filed the
attached advice letter.  If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer
a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue
Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall
from the implementation of AB 265).  The $104 million represents the
overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to
customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would
include direct access customers.  SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that
it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be
used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers).
SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case.  It was
opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission.

Protests on this advice filing are due August 6th.  Please let me know if
Enron is interested in protesting.

Hi everyone,

I know that AReM is not opposing SB 78xx (Polanco/Sher) because it is silent
on direct access; however, I want to recommend that the position be changed
to oppose.  I have spoken with Norm and he asked that I send this out to for
comment.
Please look at the bill and specifically Section 13, on Page 35 (see below).
I believe that if this bill were to become law direct access in SCE's,
PG&E's and SDG&E territories (I believe the section stands alone so it
wouldn't matter if PG&E accepted the same deal or not) would be dead.  In
summary, the bill would essentially allow any IOU to go back into the
generation business and require the CPUC to approve rates that are
sufficient to cover their reasonable cost of operation, investment and
provide for a reasonable rate of return (I don't believe this is cost-based
rates).  The CPUC is given broad latitude over conducting proceedings,
issuing orders or anything else that may be necessary to accomplish the goal
of assuring that service provided by IOU's is adequate.  Section 13 will
kill competition, eliminate direct access and create new stranded costs.
And, to add insult to injury the State Power Authority may be their partners
in crime.
As to the politics of the bill it was just amended to be a majority vote
bill.  Burton has said it is this bill or nothing.  SCE is opposing the bill
but there are several lobbyist who think this is all an ambush and SCE would
love this bill.

Please comment on my above analysis.  I would love to be wrong on this one.

The Agreement itself basically calls for DWR to set its revenue requirement

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 21, 2001

URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL 
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight 
bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight 
bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters 
the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility 
Southern California Edison. 
The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and 
Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts 
amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in 
the last year. 
"I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out 
of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to 
creditworthiness," said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned 
Friday night without voting on a similar measure. 
The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial 
and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by 
Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its 
transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its 
estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay 
skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 
Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year 
option to buy Edison's grid. 
That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it 
"neither needs nor deserves. 
"I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion 
of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support 
deregulation," Johnson said during floor debate. "The idea of Edison as the 
victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists 
bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation." 
During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials 
helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and 
then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. 
Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a 
schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding 
between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by 
Aug. 15. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said Friday. 
For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, 
has to reach Davis. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's 
offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by 
Edison ratepayers over 10 years. 
The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of "green" energy 
resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy 
service. 
The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is 
considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to 
"iron out the bills' differences," said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. 
Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer 
break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
"I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry 
about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and 
other major issues to deal with in that last month," the governor said.

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house."

Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled

Subject: California Update 07.22.01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget 
and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison 
MOU." Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and 
passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The "Edison MOU":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison 
MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays 
QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because 
the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the 
suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic 
is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the 
Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not 
pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The "Dunn Investigation":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the 
first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies."
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the 
full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican 
party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the 
date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not 
to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 
20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the 
likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return 
until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the 
budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much 
influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not 
reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says 
it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go 
back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his 
Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough 
votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released 
on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed,
some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee
members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by
TURN and other consumer groups.

During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and
Richard Katz from the Governor s office regarding a couple of issues
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently,
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff s request.  D.J. agreed that the bill
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct
access.  We suggested that  shall be changed to  may in order to give more
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn t necessarily oppose
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can
totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to
push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this
bill passes.

There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor s
desk.

The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote on
additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.

Re:        Action Needed for Veto on Workers' Comp Bill (SB 71)

The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers'
compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on
its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers

$3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to
help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the
Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a
negotiating mood.

There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor

entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a
$1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous
to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton
and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press
conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a
slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB
71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers'
costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured
workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or
someone else.

Steve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the
governor's point person on workers' compensation said, "the
governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of
labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion
about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is
comfortable with."  Smith dismissed the threat of labor
turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has
stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he
would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else.

Now that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that
employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on
SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at http://www.cmta.net/issues/index.

Subject: RE: Conference Call Advisory for SUNDAY, September 9th
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.

As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.

These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  

I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.

Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.

Talk to you at noon your time.

Best,
Jeff

Welcome back all of you veteran pickers!  I'd like to introduce our three
new rookies:

The Deitrick's - Val and Scott - from napa
Andy Bledsoe - from Napa
Kent Deverell - from San Francisco

Good luck to all!!

Steve McCarthy is not in the pool this year (we'll miss his bazaar picks)
and we aren't sure if Carlton is still in.  If he is, we'll have a total of
27; if not it'll be 26.  We'll send out a completed report of the projected
payouts before the first week of the season starts.

Attached are two Excel files.  The first one just has the pick sheet for
week #1


One easy way to submit the weekly picks is to:
1)	Click on this sheet and open it in Excel
2)	Fill in the information at the top
3)	Make your weekly picks by putting numbers in the cell with the line under
it by the team you want to pick.  (This will also give you a check figure at
the bottom to be sure you have gotten, at least,  the correct total - not
necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file
5)	Use "FORWARD" to get the e-mail back to me at eldon@direcpc.com
6)	If you use "REPLY" the attachment does not get sent

It really makes a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to do the
statistical work if you use this form so we really appreciate getting your
picks this way.

Here is an Excel workbook that contains a tab for every week - so all 17
weeks are here plus a sample.  However, all you need to send back is the
sheet for the current week.  Just to make it easier, (or in case you've
misplaced the attachment) we'll send out, via e-mail, each upcoming week's
pick sheet in time for you to make your selections.   If you have any
questions about Excel please give me a call at (707) 255-4813 or call Nancy
at (707) 251-4870.

My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.  Apologies.
 

About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

Overall looks great, though I made a few edits/comments.  But I couldn't figure out how to do it in strikeout/underline.  We should make it look as "PG&E-centric" as possible--you know how touchy IOUs are.

You and Dave and I should try to discuss in more detail early next week.

Best,
Jeff

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. 

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. 

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures." 

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC 

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. 

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said. 

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated." 

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. 

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the second letter says. 

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting.

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see. 

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts. 

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months. 

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record. 

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public. 

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market. 

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. 

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. 

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures." 

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC 

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. 

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said. 

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated." 

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. 

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the second letter says. 

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting. 

Generators Confused

( DYN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=DYN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=DYN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=DYN>), have bought apparently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see. 

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts. 

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months. 

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record. 

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public. 

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market. 

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.

We must go after this. I need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do. I see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently:

- a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August

- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension

- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions

Suggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance

Firms Push Edison Near Bankruptcy


Energy: Power generators ask firm to spell out how they will be repaid hundreds of millions of dollars for purchases under deregulation plan.

By NANCY VOGEL and JERRY HIRSCH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

September 29 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Five big energy companies owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Southern California Edison pushed the utility a step closer to bankruptcy Friday by asking Edison to sign an agreement spelling out how each will be repaid.

The companies demanded that Edison meet with them within two weeks to work out a repayment plan and implied that otherwise they would drag the Rosemead-based utility into Bankruptcy Court. Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.

The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.

The letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers.

"This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such," says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles.

"We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, "but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question.

"Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement," Bates wrote.

The five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.

Edison officials refused to comment.

The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.

Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion.

"Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.

A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. "It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us," Patrick Dorinson said.

So far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.

Davis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.

Other Creditors Take Notice

Senate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.

The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue.

"From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over," said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.

Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court.

"By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first," Moorlach said.

But Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE.

"We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy," Lawrence said.

Edison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.

By January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.

Edison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.

The generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.

Shares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

"Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." 

S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said Freeman, "but it's a good thing to have." 

But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said Marcus. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." 

* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

"When you compare those two contracts," Marcus said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said. 

"I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

If you're referring to the Tues/Thur call, we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with Sacramento folks having the option of callling in, since the Legislature's gone until January. You have thoughts on the Monday call?  That one may not be as critical anymore.

Should we set up a different call schedule for CA given the new environment - maybe just once a week?
 
If we do, we need to send out a notice to the key business people.

Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets 



(Published Oct. 7, 2001) 

A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. 

Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. 

Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. 

Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. 

The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. 

Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. 

How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. 

However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. 

It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. 

The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.

Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. 

Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. 

The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. 

"Circumstances have changed," said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market." 

Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, 

and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. 

But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. 

It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. 

At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. 

Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. 

The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. 

He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. 

But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. 

She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.

State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter


Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

"Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers." 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

"The PUC first gave Edison their bailout," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place." 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

"If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts." 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

"I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.

Sorry.  Haven't been around.  I definitely want to move forward.  I'll respond more fully if more is needed, but the short of it is, I'd like to do the entire job except for the decking.  Ready to start when you are.  Can you tell me what you expect the total to be (labor + materials), understanding that it's an estimate and not a firm price.  Also, I'm assuming that the cost for the materials that you quoted include the "bridge" to the cabin?  Will, of course, want the bridge to the cabin planked.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Really appreciate your efforts.  Looking forward to getting started.  Hope all finds you well.

Thanks for the response.  However, I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos.  Since it is still October 31, I hope you'll discard that copy and replace it with this one, which I think is now typo-free.  My apologies for the mix-up and thanks for your consideration.

Subject: Edison and the PUC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff will be talking to Fielder on this.

SCE said at our meeting Monday that they DID NOT want to talk about these issues at the PHC -- they wanted to address it through the advice letters. This one shouldn't even be up an issue at all.

Hi Sue,

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 deadline.

Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20
contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before
September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which
you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D
01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails
supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is
in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on
rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

I received your attached customer list dated 11/1/01, however, per the
attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a
certified
customer list was 10/5/2001. SCE will use the list you submitted on

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct
access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC
order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or
verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering

Hey buddie:  Just got into my email.  Let's discuss.  Not quite sure how this fits with filing an RCR per our discussion.  Either way is fine, but seems like we need to get coordinated.

Jeff, 

Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today. I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.  I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.  Jim agreed.  Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach.

Sue

Subject:	My Thoughts


I am not sure, that in any of the calls that we have had during the crisis surrounding Enron, that I have been able to fully express the depth of my gratitude to each of you.  I am as grateful as one can be.  Like many of you, I loved this place and feel an immense sense of loss at what is occurring.  My heart also aches for the financial losses that so many have suffered, not only in our group, but also throughout the company, particularly given how much all of us have given to this place, some for many years.  I have been searching for a way to capture what we've done here and was reading a book the other day about Teddy Roosevelt, former President of the United States, and saw a quote that I thought was appropriate to our group and circumstances?the quote is, 

"the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena?who strives valiantly, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in worthy causes.  Who, at best, knows the triumph of high achievement and who, at worst, if he fails, fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls, who knew neither victory nor defeat."

The work that we did here was great.  The way we did it, I believe, sets an example for those who will attempt to fill our shoes?and we fought for the right cause, i.e., competitive markets around the world.  Our victories were many and often directly due to our presence and leadership?the failure that we are experiencing as a company, however, that is so deep and so thorough, was not of our making.  I don't know exactly what the days and weeks ahead hold for any of us, but I am quite confident that the good work that we do and the way that we do it, and the sense of community that we were able to create in this group, will show up in new places and new companies all around the world over the next months and years.  I hope to speak to many, if not all of you, on a one to one basis over the next several weeks to express my thanks and gratitude for having had the opportunity to work with you, but I also want to take this opportunity to wish each of you the best in the future and during this holiday season.

Thank you
