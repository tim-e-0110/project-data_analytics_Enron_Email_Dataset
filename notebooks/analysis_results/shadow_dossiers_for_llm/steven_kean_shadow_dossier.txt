--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, thanks.  Lay is going to be giving the keynote.  It may be a hard story 
to assemble: the gas market is deregulated and structured pretty much the way 
we would like to see it done in both gas and power markets, yet we still have 
high prices.  It's a bit of a stretch to blame it all on OPEC.  I'm 
interested in any views you may have.

Subject: The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge




Mr. David Haug 
Chairman and CEO 
Enron Caribbean Basin 

Dear Mr. Haug: 

I am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that 
will be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, 
Ohio - "The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge." This 
event is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? 
Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor 
Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to 
be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy 
producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the 
current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North 
America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including 
senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically 
involved in the energy value chain.

Primary Goals of the Summit include: 

* Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas 
market 
* Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply 
potential for gas 
* Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss 
natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of 
interested State Governors.

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have 
asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to 
moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply 
Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening 
framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at 
the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working 
with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine 
Hansen.

We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to 
view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: 
http://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm

Subject: Fletcher School/Enron

Dear Steve:   Last month while at my reunion at the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy
at Tufts University, some of the school officials told me that Enron has 
hired about eight 
Fletcher graduates recently and is happy with them.   The school is also 
happy and wants
to strengthen its relationship with Enron.   They had earlier this year 
contacted a Laura 
Kalmans, Director of Community Development at Enron, to discuss various ideas 
for cooperation 
with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and 
give the students
exposure to real world issues, but nothing happened and they lost contact.  

They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I 
said 
I thought it might be you or someone under you.    They now want to send a 
letter
to someone at Enron on this proposal.  It is OK if it is addressed to you or 
should I tell
them another name?   Please advise me how to steer them in the right 
direction.    

Many thanks.  David Merrill

Dear Ambassador Merrill,

I understand that you and Betsy Ginsberg had a conversation at reunion last 
month about a possible
partnership between the Fletcher School and Enron.  Thank you for generously 
offering to help us
explore this connection.  We believe there are strong synergies between 
Professor Bill Moomaw's
International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business 
model.  There is
currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there 
are nine Fletcherites
at Enron at this time.  I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship 
is a solid first step
from which to launch an even stronger partnership.

In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director 
of Community
Development, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring.  
Unfortunately, the scheduling
did not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had 
trouble identifying a new
point of contact.

I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean.  As 
Senior Vice President for
Public and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal 
contact with whom to
discuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we 
proceed?  Should we send
a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to 
meet with Professor
Moomaw?  May I mention that you suggested we write him?

At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared 
for Enron, along with
the letter we originally mailed to Elise.  I would be very interested in any 
suggestions you may
have.  If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, 
please let me know and
I would be happy to mail or fax them.  Thank you again for your kind offer of 
assistance.

Sincerely,

Laura Karch

		 Subject: FCEL

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey

I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point.  For example, how much of 
the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes?  He wants to make the 
point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly 
progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.

		 Subject: Fiber Optic Public Lands Right-of-Way Status

The fat lady hasn't quite sung yet, but I thought it would be a good idea to 
give you a readout on the current status of the BLM/USFS fiber optic 
right-of-way issue.

In a nutshell, our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the 
concessions we sought.  As you'll recall these were:

a) to get the BLM to withdraw any "interim" policies, the first of which 
split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version 
that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each 
time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a 
retroactivity clause that added extra sting;
b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed 
its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual 
"comparable" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees 
in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, 
increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);
c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 
2001; and
d) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested 
stakeholders, including Enron.

Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the 
Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from 
points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d.   The language we 
inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the 
Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee 
schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and 
forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for 
future rent determination.

The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is 
because the issue still hasn't quite closed.  The Interior Appropriations 
Bill may very well be vetoed.  But since our issue was settled at the staff 
level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being 
re-examined and challenged.  In fact, any changes would likely only increase 
the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert 
even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the 
agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 
18 months.  Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive 
discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged 
agreements on timing and specific ways forward.   Details are forthcoming, 
but Enron would be involved closely in the process.  The agencies were 
clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to 
negotiate.

But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from 
implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process 
either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal 
year.  And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and 
organizing and leading the 20-member  Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way 
Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the 
communications field. 

Steve

you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think 
you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with 
Schroeder re: Littlechild.  

Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I 
had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind 
contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost 
of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am 
surprised to see it turn up in print.  

Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about 
this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In 
fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one 
but that we're always interested in working together.

Jeff, I sent this e-mail to Kean last night.  I am fine with your 
recommendation for Skilling to pass on this event.  Do you want to deliver 
the news to Lee.  Do we want to offer you, Steve Kean, or me as an 
alternative?  Personally, I would like to attend but don't have much interest 
in speaking (assuming that they would allow low lifes like you or me to 
speak).  Your call on all of this.  Call bob Badeer with questions about the 
BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours.


Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the 
best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our 
powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my 
view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.

Also, one question:

Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have 
that right?

Jeff and Tim,

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk "Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation."

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

		 Subject: Azurix, Grand Rapids contract

John Stokes. Laird Smith and I spoke with Eric Schneidewind this afternoon.  
Varnum is currently representing the city on isolated matters.  Varnum is 
approaching the city attorney to obtain a waiver of any conflict of interest 
so that they may engage in lobbying activities on Azurix's behalf.  Eric is 
very confident that the city attorney will issue with waiver.  Varnum made it 
clear that should Azurix lose the contract and wish to engage in any legal 
action against the city, then Azurix would not be able to use Varnum b/c of 
their existing relationship with the city.  John assured Eric that it is 
extremely unlikely that Azuriz would ever pursue legal action against the 
city.

John Stokes has asked that Varnum deal directly with Tom Maxwell in the 
Edmonton office once the waiver is obtained.

They will keep us posted on progress.

Subject: Azurix, Grand Rapids contract  

I have spoken with Eric Schneidewind our attorney at Varnum, Riddering, 
Schmidt and Howlett in Lansing.  He is contacting other attorneys in the firm 
to follow up on this immediately.  Varnum is one of the two major west 
Michigan law firms and is based in Grand Rapids.  

John Stokes and I have spoken.  As soon as I learn anything from our 
attorneys, I will be in contact with him.

I also have a call into our lobbying firm, Karoub Associates.  I doubt that 
they could be more effective than Varnum on this one, but I want them in the 
loop b/c they might have some pull with key officials in Grand Rapids.

I will keep you posted.

		 Subject: Help in Michigan

Once again, I come to you for help.  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.  We had bid against the 
incumbent, a company called Synagro.  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not 
related.  In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us.  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned, and appears to have been successful.  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may 
be pure politics.  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids?  We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid.  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues.  Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a 
little flat-footed.   

Any suggestions?

Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% 
year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct 
group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate 
allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be 
able to achieve this goal?

		 Subject: Re: BackWeb

Steve:

At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they 
can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.  There are still four 
important issues, however:

IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.  This means 
that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron 
organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.
No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use 
their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic 
instead.  WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a 
separate company.
HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because 
survey responses cannot be made anonymous.  HR has already purchased a tool 
called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.
Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same 
domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent 
by the message administrator.

Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and 
disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and 
read them later (as they can with e-mail).  This means that I could be away 
from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it 
would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.

The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but 
they lack commercial sponsorship.  They are hoping Corp will foot the bill 
for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing 
it company-wide.

Please let us know if you have additional questions.

Steve,

Thank you for taking the time to see me whenever I have requested an 
appointment with you. I believe there are discussions to consolidate Enron 
websites and also to develop a Knowledge Management infrastructure.  You and 
I have shared some thoughts on these subjects. Properly managed, these are 
potent tools in the strategic mix that would help keep Enron innovative. I 
know that no concrete plans have yet emerged from your deliberations but I 
can foresee when you might want someone to lead this effort full time.

It is eminently sensible to move towards consolidation in both areas. Among 
the several benefits, a common infrastructure would sharply reduce both 
development and maintenance costs.  Also, we would eliminate duplications and 
give coherence to the look and feel of websites that would emphasize 
corporate branding.  

I am doing some great things here at EBS and generally speaking I am happy. 
Nevertheless, I see a tremendous potential in this role and very much would 
like to be considered a prime candidate for the lead position in this effort. 
Everything I have done here at Enron has richly prepared me for this 
position. My relationship with business units has given me a unique 
education.  I have developed information value chain, built and managed three 
websites in three different operating companies. At all times my products 
were considered benchmarks. In addition, I shall be able to manage potential 
political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation. 

I should be grateful if you would think about this. 

Once again, thank you for your time.

Facilities Management Responsibilities



Enron Energy Services is presently a marketing affiliate of several of the 
Enron pipelines because EES: (1) buys/sells gas; and (2) holds transport 
contracts on our pipelines.  

Under the FERC's standards of conduct, the pipelines cannot: (1) share 
transportation information or shipper information with EES; (2) must function 
independently and keep separate books and records.  Generally, I don't see 
the FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning 
types of services.  However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with 
respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate 
standards of conduct:

1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate "access" to 
transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file 
room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a 
marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me that 
EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function 
for NNG, TW or NBPL.

2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent 
Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge 
records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not 
operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management 
charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving 
us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate 
functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.

Responsibilities


Responsibility  for daily operations of building support services in the 
Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be 
transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.  The 
areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, 
electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;  
food, copier, and records services.

This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and 
Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron,s Business 
Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to 
their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility 
for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of 
EES,s Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.

EPSC is responsible for Enron,s internal real estate and office development 
needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project 
and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.  EPSC, 
in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration 
Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, 
reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.

This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus 
resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and 
managing the development of Houston,s new Enron Center Campus project.

Dear Mr. Kean,

   Hello, I am Christian Schmollinger, a reporter with Natural Gas
Week. I'm not sure if you remember but we met at the press briefing that Mr.
Skilling held at the National Press Building at the end of the summer here
in Washington to discuss the California electricity markets.
   I am contacting you today in the hopes that I might be able to speak
with you or someone else from Enron for a story I am working on for this
week's issue concerning American natural gas marketers moving into Europe. I
was hoping I could interview someone with the company before Thursday so
that I could write the story before my Friday deadline.
   For the story, I am basically looking to do background, i.e. How is
the European market different from the American market? Will the network
business model translate well there? What kind of regulatory pitfalls do the
companies' face? Will a liquid natural gas market develop in Europe? If so,
what kind of timeline are we talking about? What is Enron's position and
take on the whole European market?
   I would appreciate any time or guidance you might be able to give me
on this subject. If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate
to call. Once again, thanks for your time.

		 Subject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order

Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.   
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market 
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what 
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact, 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was 
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A 
Court battle was threatened.

		 Subject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order

There are a few other issues we need to look into:

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I 
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it 
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.  
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we 
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, 
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply

Subject: Re: talking points on California situation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

Mark,

Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note 
that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 
1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal 
utilities in the state.  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers -- 
that's what all the  fuss was about in 1997.  Anyone else feel free to take 
your own shot.

Sue

It's worth noting too (perhaps as part of Jeff's first or second points) that 
in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, 
and the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in 
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other 
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and 
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have 
ordered.

Subject: US Chamber
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom 
Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to 
$100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and 
wanted you to know why.

I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue 
has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, 
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My 
reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something 
which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it 
will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of 
this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but 
instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they 
decided to have a "process".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to 
participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it 
came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform 
(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the 
federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not 
exclusively the Chamber's fault).

Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to 
raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a 
few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a 
veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things 
everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower 
corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and 
things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  

As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging 
conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating 
incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some 
members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with 
us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an 
extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the 
business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next 
level, not just protecting its current position.

Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) 
has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has 
intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I 
have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members 
at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access 
to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 
range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our 
current dues to $100,000).

Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan 
to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you 
prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Rick,

You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov 14 with 
John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power 
Pool intended to implement in two days.  We developed a 5 point action plan 
to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a 
significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.    
By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the 
Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude 
importers from setting pool price.  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule 
changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron 
will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we 
should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of 
Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to 
encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will 
finalize our "Lessons from other Jurisdictions" document (that Steve sent me 
materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and 
Power Pool and then follow up with them.

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday.

Rob

Subject: DRAFT - Document for next week
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can 
see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into 
much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and 
evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The 
main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
Board meeting.

I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with 
McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside 
opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My 
question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have 
some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often 
lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and 
that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
(ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an 
analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out 
the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a 
low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
performance reasons) if possible.

Steve,

Attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with Jeff
next week.  As you might imagine, we've been going through many iterations
of this document, and it is still very much a work-in-process.  Hopefully,
you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading, but the
specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed.

We look forward to getting your reaction/feedback to the structure and
overall message.

Suzanne asked me to give you her home number, (713) 807-7788, where you can
reach her over the weekend.  Otherwise, please feel free to leave a
voicemail for either Suzanne (713) 751-4390 or me (214) 665-1754.

Thanks,
Dan Marcontell

I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the 
presentation.   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking 
points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.  Some of the 
points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in 
addition to outlining the changes.  Some of the themes which we should 
develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our 
growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- 
Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees 
on this e-mail).  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a 
professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation 
incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across 
the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and 
a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.

I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting 
before we get together with Jeff.  I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday.

		 Subject: EGEP/EOGIL Customs Duty Inquiry on Offshore Production

We were served summons by the Customs Office in Surat asking for meetings 
with our platform managers and on Dec.12th we sent two representatives 
(operations mgr & legal) to answer their questions.  Over a two day period 
they inquired about production and logistical issues and asked a number of 
questions regarding product delivery points, pricing formulas, etc.   In 
summary, they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the 
crude we sell in India is subject to a 10-12% customs duty since it is 
produced outside of the 12 mile territorial limit.  They are trying to make 
the case that we are importing the gas and oil into India.  Obviously this is 
not the case and there is no merit for such consideration, but we don't want 
to let this idea get entered as a show/cause filing against Enron and our 
partners.  There would be remedies such as court or arbitration, but the 
timing to resolve this is probably 1-2 years.  Furthermore, this issue would 
most likely impact current efforts we have on-going.  Therefore, we are 
taking the issue very seriously and plan to meet in Mumbai next Thursday to 
chart an appropriate course of action.  Once we meet, we will get back to 
Cliff and Jim Derrick regarding our recommendation on Thursday morning 
December 21st Houston time.  Cliff and Jim, if you are planning to be out of 
the office, please drop me an e-mail where you can be reached.

Meeting in Mumbai next Thursday will be Chris Walker of Linklaters, local 
Indian counsel (Saberwal ?), myself, Mike Stewart, Dominic Carolan (EGEP 
legal), and certain representatives from EOGIL.  We would also like to have 
Jane Wilson(EIPL Gov't & Regulatory affairs for India) present if she is 
available.  Jane it is not mandatory that you are present, but if you can't 
attend could you send me an e-mail where I could reach you if necessary.  The 
meeting will be at EOGIL's office and Fatima Samuel will confirm the time and 
place once Chris Walker's schedule is known.  It is my understanding that 
Chris Walker will be in India on Tuesday and Wednesday working with Wade's 
group on other matters. 

This issue came up originally in 1997 right after we started producing gas at 
Tapti.  At that time we had 3 legal opinions prepared and the legal team 
tells me the positions were very strong in our favor on a variety of fronts.  
After a few meetings and a couple of letters the issue went away and never 
resurfaced again until now.  We suspect that this issue has been an open item 
since that time and for a variety of reasons (ongoing activities ?) someone 
feels it needs to be checked off the list.  Hence, the revived interest at 
this time.  

The reason we are giving this such a high level of attention is probably 
obvious, but the reason we want to act upon our plan immediately once we get 
together next Thursday may seem less necessary.  However, today our office 
received 3 more summons for 3 different people to report to Surat next 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  This time they have asked for our 
production manager, logistics manager and lead accountant.  We have requested 
an extension due to the short notice and holiday season and expect to have it 
granted, but we will not know if it is postponed before Monday.   (If we have 
to go we will have legal counsel attend with the individuals named)  This 
level of back to back activity for a government office at this time year is a 
concern.  Going into the meeting with the legal guys on Thursday, we are 
thinking that we need to have a highly respected person(such as Saberwal) 
deliver  our message (to multiple groups, i.e., Surat customs, Ministry of 
Finance, Mopng) as to the lack of validity for this potential claim and what 
we would do if they proceed.   By Thursday I think we will have all of the 
necessary "color" on this issue and with the team mentioned above we will be 
able to develop the right plan of action.  However, due to the level of 
interest and activity of the Surat Customs group, we anticipate that our 
recommendation will be to move quickly, hence, my desire to contact Cliff and 
Jim next Thursday for approval to proceed.  

I have included Wade and Rebecca(EIPL) as well as Steve and John(PR) for 
information purposes at this time.    
This first stage plan we will be seeking approval for next Thursday will be 
to meet with certain people in an attempt to keep this from becoming an 
issue.  This should be a fairly quiet issue (for Indian standards) next week 
and even the subsequent meetings that I'm anticipating would take place in 
the following two weeks ought to be very low keyed items.  However, in India 
you never know and considering some of the existing press of recent we should 
get prepared and make sure we are co-ordinated.   John, following our 
Thursday decision we should probably talk about our plan so if you'll leave 
me a note where you can be reached, I'd appreciate it.  

In summary, the odds are we will be able to manage this and it won't become a 
big issue.  However, we need to take this very seriously and deal with it 
proactively and quickly before someone files something without understanding 
the consequences of the action.  I am leaving for India on Sunday and when 
possible I will pick up my mail.  I will also be checking voicemail if you 
need to leave a message.   I will be the Mumbai office on Tuesday, Thursday 
and Friday and in Delhi on Wednesday. 

Jeff

Proposal for Single Number Range for the New Enron Campus

For the opening of the New Enron Campus and the changing of the street  
address from 1400 Smith St to 1500 Louisiana, we propose that 
Enron elects to take a single DID number range for all in-bound 
telecommunications.
This single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a DID 
to an employee
and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a "Plug 
n Play" environment.

Currently we have over 21000 DID's in operation in the following locations EB 
, 2AC , 3AC , 500/600 Jeffersen and Penzoil Place . 
The numbers are spread across three different ranges :

- 713 853 xxxx ( 6300 numbers )
- 713 345 xxxx ( 10,000 numbers )
- 713 646 xxxx  ( 5,000 numbers )

The proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future 
requirements. The benefits are :

 - less confusion to Enron customers and internal users
 - sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area
 - increased capacity from one  range of numbers to cater for Fax or 
multimedia applications
 - have a new identity to fall in line with ''One Enron'' philosophy

Due to the high utilization of DID numbers in the downtown area, we will not 
get a (713) area code allocation, and we will be looking at the new ( 832) 
area code.
We have been investigating (832) 363(ENE) XXXX as the range, however this 
cannot be guaranteed.

To take this forward, I require high level approval of the scheme, we will 
then pressure the suppliers and regulatory committee's to meet Enron's 
requirements.

I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand

		 Subject: Re: Financial Analysis of PG&E and Proposed Terms for Settlement

The underlying assumptions for the resources are that they return to some 
business as usual amortization of these assets (a 20 to 30 year amortization) 
assuming that none of the generating assets are uneconomic.  Further, it 
assumes non-revenue earning regulatory assets (other than the TRA 
undercollections) are amortized over the next 5 years.

		 Subject: Re: Financial Analysis of PG&E and Proposed Terms for Settlement

Attached is a new version of the power cost model incorporating Roger's 
updated info (retained generation costs and QF capacity payments).  It 
improves the outlook for PG&E by > $2.00/MWH, mainly as a result of lower 
cost estimates for their hydro.  SCE's numbers remains about the same.  FYI, 
the prices in the model are at mid.  The switch to change to offer is now on 
the Summary page.

Attached is an article that we have drafted with the help of a McK
Quarterly editor.   We have set up a call for tomorrow at 10:00  (CST) in
order to talk through the article and the implications to our clients.  We
have received very good and constructive comments from many of you which we
have tried to incorporate (as much as a 750 word limit would allow).  We
believe we have a shot at a Monday op-ed piece in the WSJ if we send this
out Friday.  The events of today highlight the timeliness of this issue.
Looking forward to talking to you tomorrow.

		 Subject: Update --Third Session -- Day 4 -- PRINCIPALS MEET SATURDAY

Friday, January 12, 2001

By the end of the day, the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold 
another meeting with the CEOs, Governor Davis and various other Government 
officials.  Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video 
conference was set up with two locations:  one at DOE in Washington and one 
in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.  It was tentatively set up 
for 2:30 pm CST.  I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve 
Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.

Long-Term Forward Contracts

Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.  It includes a 
draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products 
required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.
Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, 
given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.


Debt and Forebearance

Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.


QF Contract Reformation

Parties continued discussion
No information was available by COB Friday.

Major Issues

State interest in resolving
State willingness to raise retail rates
Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager
Willingness to "call off the dogs" for the suppliers and to release them from 
legal action
State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development
Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation


Next Steps

If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, 
this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the 
week of Jan 15.

If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, 
such as:
FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.
RFO completion and release by Jan 18
Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 
2.
Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR)
Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this 
settlement

And more...

OUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA

EES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E 
(about 800 MW of usage) [NOTE - CHECK WITH EES].  EES has natural gas 
customers within the territories PG&E and SoCal Gas.

Enron does not have any generation in California (we own a small QF in Nevada 
but only have 50 MW excess).  

We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in 
California or by transmitting power into the state.  Enron sells natural gas 
to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements.

Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by 
using the full complement of resources of EES - demand reduction, load 
shaping, and efficiency improvements.

Transwestern has long-term capacity arrangements with PG&E.

OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA / MESSAGES

The current situation (shortages and potential bankruptcy) is not the result 
of competitive markets, rather it is the result of barriers to workable 
retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model 
(for instance, the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market, the 
residual CTC calculation, incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring 
direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities' 
common costs). 

Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those 
naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against 
competition.  Enron disagrees.  What it proves is that not finishing the job 
of creating real competition can result in problems.  

Enron believes that there are workable short-term and long-term solutions for 
California.

In the short-term, (1) California must provide credit enhancement or directly 
buy power for the Utilities' needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity, 
(2) California should incent customers to institute demand reductions, and 
(3) California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the 
Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy.

In the long-term, (1) California needs to continue its activities to promote 
retail competition (and most importantly it must allow real price signals to 
be sent to large customers), (2) California should implement the changes that 
the FERC highlighted (end the reliance on the spot market, remove 
stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board, give the Utilties the ability to recover 
wholesale power costs), (3) California must remove unnecessary barriers to 
the development of additional generation capacity, and, most importantly, (4) 
California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop 
a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market 
volatility.

California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation 
assets or transmission facilities.  

California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which 
allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator.

KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA

We do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be 
an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs. We continue to sell to 
creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets. [NOTE - THE AMOUNT OF 
RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE].

The PX Credit (and associated negative CTC) continues to be an issue.  Enron 
believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PG&E's and SCE's 
tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customer's agent.  We filed 
a Complaint Friday January 19 at the CPUC.  We are confident that these funds 
will be recovered.  [NOTE - I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS - AGAIN 
AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE]

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies "going forward"
Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details.

Title: High Speed Regulation in California
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2208


A Feverish Pitch
The pace of regulatory and political events in California has taken on the
feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself. Important decisions
regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at 
the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state Legislature,
increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already perceive
in the quickly evolving California market. Sudden changes are being made to 
the
market structure, changes that used to require years in California,s complex
regulatory and legislative proceedings.

As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern California
on January 17 and 18, including in portions of downtown San Francisco,
Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley, state officials are scrambling to set up
the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarce
western energy supplies to California,s two largest utilities. Even at prices
near $800 per megawatt-hour (MWh), the California Department of Water 
Resources
(CDWR), attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
and Southern California Edison (SCE), has been unable to secure enough to keep
the lights on. In the mean time, legal actions by some energy suppliers
threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy*and are being held at bay only 
by
direct intervention of California,s governor.

Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently:

*California governor. California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt to
act on behalf of PG&E and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from
merchant generation owners and marketers in California. On the same front, the
governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them from
seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utilities.
Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy.

*Legislature. Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchases
on behalf of PG&E and SCE by the CDWR, to restructure the independent system
operator,s (ISO) governing board to consist of five members appointed by the
governor, to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader 
interstate
regional transmission organization (RTO) without the explicit approval of
California,s Electricity Oversight Board, and to prohibit the divestiture of
the investor-owned utilities, remaining generating assets until 2006. The
vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition of
transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still
being developed.

*California Public Utilities Commission. On January 18 the CPUC adopted a
decision prohibiting the sale of SCE,s Mohave Generating Station to AES. This
voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed 
decisions
regarding SCE,s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency criteria
for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.

Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their
respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass 
through
multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to
decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to
California,s two largest utilities, or the level of uncertainty in developing
new generation to supply California in the future.

The ISO anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies (reserves less than
1.5 percent) for January 19 and will most likely continue to curtail
interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are being
strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water 
supplies
are already as much as 25 percent below average, owing to low precipitation 
and
continued plant outages near 9,000 MW in California. The gravity of the
financial condition of California,s two largest utilities is exemplified by 
the
need for other, more creditworthy intermediaries, including California
municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers, to
act as temporary  guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PG&E
and SCE.

Dear Steven,

You have very kindly directed us in the right direction before.

Derek (Goodwin) has asked me to contact you. Derek is organizing a UK
Technology Forum on behalf of the Houston British Consulate General &
Invest.UK offices to be held in Houston in March. The purpose of which is to
foster & strengthen links between the technology-driven communities of
Houston & the UK. BT will showcase the leading-edge technology
infrastructure in the UK and a British Consulate General/Invest.UK speaker
will outline of the resources available to facilitate business expansion to
the UK.

The Forum will take the form of a breakfast & include the welcome &
introduction of a keynote speaker and a panel of 3 other speakers from
Houston based technology companies that have set-up an operation in the UK.
The panelists will give a brief overview of the why's & wherefor's behind
their decision to locate in the UK. The Forum will conclude with a moderated
Q&A session.

As Houston is a fast growing high-tech city, especially in the energy
sector, Derek has asked if you can refer him to the right person within
Enron with whom he can speak regarding Enron's possible involvement in the
Forum.

We'd appreciate any help you can give.

Sincerely,

Brian Medd-Sygrove
Vice Consul (Investment)

Leslie:  I have delivered a letter and resume to Senator Domenici's office.
I am attaching a copy of my letter to Senator Domenici and my resume.  There
are already a couple of letters sent to Senator Domenici on my behalf;
however, I do not know the best way to time this thing because President
Bush has to get his administration in place and there are a lot of positions
that will require Senate confirmation and everything is running behind
because of all the post election issues.  If you get a chance to talk with
Steve Cane about my application, I would certainly appreciate it.  I am sure
there are people at Enron close to Senator Domenici and he is the one who
will be making the call, so I would be interested in knowing what you and
Steve think.  In any event, thanks for all your help and let me know if the
attachments do not come through with this e-mail.  I am still somewhat
incompetent when it comes to e-mail technology although I think it is a
great way to communicate.  As an aside, in divorce cases where the two
parties have internet access, I require them to communicate by e-mail.
Thanks and I'll see you back in Roswell.  Chip

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies "going forward"
Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details.

 Crisis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think there is merit in pursuing this.  A couple of comments:
It may be unduly complicated to get customers to provide the funding.  
Perhaps we should focus on the banks instead.  The deal might be further 
funding in exchange for legislative and regulatory concessions on rates, 
transmission and generation siting and the rest of the items you outline.
Rubin would be great to have, but having watched Summers in action I'm not 
sure we need another ex-treas.  Summers is superb, up-to-speed, and 
apparently willing to work on this.  Linda -- how would Larry feel if we 
brought in his ex-boss (I know they're buddies but does Summers really need 
the help?).
Need to keep an eye on the ball for large customers-- many of whom are ours.  
they will continue to need some access to better rates.  Perhaps the proposal 
could be converted to cash in exchange for demand reductions.

Dean Tyson:

It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet you 
and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I 
wanted to summarize where we left off at today,s meeting regarding California,
s energy crisis.  That summary is attached.  I've also attached three 
articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolster 
our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meeting.

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy is 
a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, it 
appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that success 
requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.  
The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed that 
all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot. 
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of 
success and is greatly appreciated.  

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made at 
the meeting.  It represents a &first cut,8 it will undoubtedly change as the 
details get worked out, and I,m sure I,ve missed something.  So please don,t 
hesitate to edit the draft.

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal 
internally.  As such, I can,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the 
proposal.  But I,m confident that the company can support something akin to 
this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.

In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has played 
a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and 
analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort as 
well.

Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washington 
D.C. office.  If she can help in any way, please don,t hesitate to let me 
know.  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to 
discuss things further.  My home phone is 415.621.8317.

Best,
Jeff

Everyone---conference call on Monday Jan 29 at 2:15pm central time to discuss 
strategy for Steve Kean's participation in the Feb 2 meeting in Portland.  
Please take a look at the materials that Alan Comnes sent out earlier today 
so that we can discuss which charts/information should be included in Kean's 
materials packet.  Call in number:

 1-877-322-9654  pin #793474 host #299461          12:15 west/2:15

Maureen--if Steve is able to join us after his 2:00 appointment that would be 
great--we should be able to narrow the discussion down a bit by the time he 
joins the call.  Thanks.

Hey all---  Paul is meeting with Gov Kempthornes office tomorrow, so we 
should be able to let everyone know where we think the governors are heading 
and it would be good to share whatever info the folks in the DC office have 
gathered prior to the WGA meeting in Portland.  Could each of you please let 
me know if you are available for a conference call on Monday Jan 29th in the 
afternoon.  I'm thinking 2:00 central.

Western matters back together to discuss who will call whom?  Sue, can you 
arrange the right time, etc.?

Saturday night at one of the inaugural events.  I'll call you to give you the 
details, including all the good things I said about you!!!  He was being 
quite negative about the WGA Feb 2 meeting in Portland, basically saying that 
his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement 
with, and that he didn't think he wanted to participate.  I promised him that 
either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give 
him our sense of where the positions/players were going to shake out.  My 
initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side, 
but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not 
having FERC there.  As you saw by the e mail exchange last week between 
Cynthia Sandherr and me, the democrat senators Murray and Cantwell are also 
following this meeting, although I don't know if they are participating.

I'll call you tomorrow and fill you in on the conversation

Linda--I also made a small commitment on tobacco issues that I'll need to 
talk to you about!

Steve
 With regard to Dabhol, Tom Briggs and I have already provided a status 
briefing on the Dabhol situation to agencies across the government - 
including DoEnergy, DOCommerce,DOState and DOTreasury.  The briefing was with 
staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand.   As the new 
administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will 
brief them - all the way up to the cabinet officals.  I understand that Colin 
Powell has already been briefed on the situation  and I know the Ambasssador 
has been front and center on the issue.
 If we were to move into a crisis mode, we will need to brief senior officals 
of the new administration at each of the  above agencies as well as the VP's 
office.  Given their interest I think we will be able to do that quickly.
 We have also briefed OPIC and EXIM about the situation - they are 
comfortable at this point.
 I am also getting the World Bank re-engaged to the extent that it is helpful 
and not a problem.  They have resources that can help MSEB reform themselves 
if MSEB will view it has a help.  It is a sensitive issue because the Bank 
has historically been anti-Dabhol so I am taking it step by step.
 If you have any other questions just let me know.  thanks John

Dear Peter,

We are very happy with your suggestion and we would like to propose that the
presentation also includes the interactions between power and gas trading
and access to networks, since the conference is about the convergence of
these two sectors.

We would be very greatful if you could identify the speaker and the title of
the presentation during the following days so that this can be included in
the programme as soon as possible and go for final printing.

What do you think about a title like?: Trading of gas and electricity and
access to networks : what does the California experience learn us?

Best regards and thank you agan.

Ana

Reverting to you after some delay, Ana, I confirm our willingness to
provide a senior speaker. We may be able to secure a Houston-based
corporate executive level Managing Director if you can give us the latitude
to introduce the subject of experiences in California and lessons for the
European power markets. This would still be a trading and wholesale
perspective, and indeed the lessons relate partly to issues of power
imports and exports across state boundaries. What do you think?
Regards,
          Peter.

Steve:

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

Marty Sunde

Steve,

Thank you for agreeing to speak at the ETS HR Conference.  Since we spoke 
last week, the meeting date has changed from February 20 to Monday, February 
26 to better accomodate presentors' and attendees schedules.  We have 
confirmed that this date works well for both you and Stan Horton.  On the 
26th, we will kick off the afternoon session with lunch at 12:15 PM, followed 
by your presentation from 1:30-2:30 and Stan's from 2:30-3:30.  You are 
invited to have lunch with us and spend as much time with us that afternoon 
as your schedule allows.

To follow up on our conversation last week, it would be great if you could 
talk to the group about Enron's performance in 2000, its successes and 
stumbles, and how ENE's stock price is impacted.  It would also be helpful if 
you could discuss the look of Enron in 2001, what its primary busninesses are 
and how they drive earnings; as well as what significant initiatives Enron 
has planned for 2001.  I have asked Stan to talk about ETS' performance 
during 2000, what he was pleased with and what lessons were learned.  He also 
will share his perspective on how ETS fits into Enron's plans for 2001, as 
well as what initiatives and objectives are critical to ETS' success this 
year.

Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule to spend it with the ETS HR 
team.  I look forward to seeing you on February 26.

Gary

Subject: New Economy Conference with Senate Democrats


Mr. Skilling,

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and Senators Daschle,
Murray, Wyden, Leahy, Bingaman, Kerry, Baucus, Carnahan, Durbin, Dorgan and
Schumer are hosting a series of discussions on the future of the New Economy
in Beaver Creek, Colorado on March 2-4, 2001.  At this time, we have about
40 executives from venture capital, communications and other high tech
businesses attending the conference.  Most of those attendees joined the
DSCC's High Technology Council in 2000.

The Council was created last year in order to create a bridge between
Democratic Senators and key leaders of the New Economy.  Throughout 2000, we
hosted dinners, meetings and conferences that gave high tech leaders and
Senators the opportunity to engage in an ongoing dialogue on the key issues
facing the nation.  As a result, the Senators and participants in the
Council were able to develop a solid understanding of the challenges facing
both government and business.  We hope that this effort has created a
foundation for strong, long-term relationships between the two groups.

The Conference in March is a continuation of last year's efforts, but we
will focus on a few of the key issues facing the New Economy to allow both
sides can drill down and gain a better understanding of some of the
opportunities and problems we will face in the near future.

In order to attend, you would need to become a member of the DSCC's High
Tech Council by donating $25,000 to the DSCC.  That would make you eligible
to participate in a series of events, conferences and meetings this year
with other industry leaders and Democratic Senators.

I have attached an invitation to the event, a registration form and
information on becoming a member of the Council.  We have reserved only a
small number of rooms for new members of the DSCC's High Tech Council.  If
you would like to attend, please let me know as soon as possible and please
do not hesitate to contact me regarding any questions, concerns or for more
information.  I can have a firm agenda to you in the very near future but I
am waiting on some feedback from people like yourself regarding the issues
they would like to discuss.  In your response, please let me know if you
have any particular issues that are of concern to you.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chad FitzGerald
Director - DSCC High Technology Council
(202) 485-3156

Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits 
in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products 
and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the 
transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the 
same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing 
on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a 
couple of months ago.

I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a
comprehensive solution is needed.  The only concern I have is the reference
at the end of the first paragraph to  "the crisis grows daily with no clear
resolution offering long term relief in sight."  In fact we do no have
several bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating
repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary
conservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a
Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X.  So I am
concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the
notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a
long term solution.  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal
elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to
be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the
following elements....and then lay out our case.

Sandi, do you agree with my concerns?  Otherwise the elements of the letter
are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative
language.  I will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of
review, even though we may later want to consoliate the entire package.  

Please call if you have any more questions.  

Thanks, 
Mike Day

Dear Steve,

This is Amy Kim (I am "borrowing" this e-mail address for the next
week and a half).  I was a Summer Associate with the CALME
Group (as it was known then) this past summer.  I was introduced
to you by Michael Moran.  As you may recall, I interviewed with
you back in September for a possible position within your division
for this summer.  Again, I appreciate you fitting me into your busy
schedule.  I enjoyed our conversation about the East Asian
economy.

You asked that I keep in touch with you throughout the last year of
my studies.  I recently spoke with Michael Moran to get his opinion
on how best to contact you.  He suggested that I e-mail you with
an update as to how I'm doing and of my continued interest in
working in Government Affairs and Regulations.

I will be graduating this June with a J.D. and Ph.D. in Political
Science.  I will be taking the bar exam for New York and
Massachusetts.  I would like to express my interest in joining your
group.  I feel that working within your group would provide me with
the opportunity to incorporate my vast knowledge of the political
arena as well as my interest in international law (environment,
energy, etc.).

I hope that you still consider me a good candidate for this position.
I look forward to your reply.

Regards,


Amy Kim

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

Can we also get something in the stip that limits the market making activity

		 Subject: PJM Stip


Attached is the proposed Stip to allow PJM to move forward as an RTO.

In the Stip, we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our 
acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets.

My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion 
management.  

While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited, I believe 
that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast 
markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk.

In addition, I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its 
software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want 
everything in their package.

Sarah is out until Monday when we need to get back with PJM.

Jim

I think we need some clear indication that with Hogan on the Board this is 
not going to turn into a diatribe about the benefits of LMP.  He's the most 
informed of the bunch and I doubt he would find a general work of interest 
(unless he can create a platform for his more detailed ideas).  If it stays 
general, I think the study is a good idea.  One topic area might be to 
explore how politicians mess up the basic idea of deregualtion and suggest 
that the process needs to be handled in a more objective (and pure) fashion.

		 Subject: Re: Analysis by Academics----Why De-regulation is the right policy 
choice  

Great points.  Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants 
list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where 
markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity.  

That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about 
what the goal of this "study" would be, which will determine, to a large 
degree, whether we choose to pursue it.  

I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to 
serve one purpose:  to influence the policy decision currently under debate 
"To de-regulate or not."  As such, I wouldn't see issues like "PJM or APX" or 
"competitive default supplier or not," or "divest generation with vesting 
contracts or retain the assets" being the focus.  

That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to 
come in "Round 2," once the initial debate over "deregulate or not" is won.  
To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case 
for the specific, "right" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study 
down, perhaps interminably.  And it seems that time is of the essence in the 
current environment.  In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is 
won--and won rather quickly--debating  implementation may be moot.  Of 
course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on "how to do 
it," but that would not be the emphasis.

In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to 
proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high 
level policy level question of "to deregulate or not," and address 
implementation in a second, or follow up, study.  I think we should try to 
make a call on this swiftly, since the "go/no go" decision would seem to flow 
from resolution of this issue.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

It would be helpful to get some feedback prior to starting to deal with the 
fundamental question related to direct access for smaller customers.  I would 
like to know Teece's perspective on the role of government in this 
marketplace.  In addition, I think that the paper must deal with the 
drawbacks of having mixed roles - utility default supply and competitive 
markets.

		 Subject: Analysis by Academics----Why De-regulation is the right policy 
choice  

Greetings:

As I've mentioned, I've been discussing with a group of academics 
(principally from UC Berkeley) the possibility of producing an analysis of 
why it makes sense to move forward toward de-regulation, and makes no sense 
to turn back to command-and-control regulation.  Clearly, we're at a fork in 
the policy road---move forward, or go back.  

I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group.  It's attached.  Please take 
a look.  I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but 
wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it 
would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to 
read.  Few points worth mentioning:

The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with 
LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron.  
List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the 
recent op-ed piece in the WSJ.
The list also includes Hogan and Joskow  and Borenstein.  We could certainly 
exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis.  
However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., "de-regulation 
is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that 
it does not work."  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the 
"authors" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies 
to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing 
course.  The analysis would not be a debate over "To Poolco, or not to 
Poolco, PJM, etc."  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could 
offer the added benefit of creating a "Nixon goes to China" scenario.  Please 
take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract 
from the list.
Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be 
David Teece, Chairman of LECG.)
None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political 
spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and 
strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan).
The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across 
the country to support the project.  This is for two reasons:  1) the more 
diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) 
they are asking for about $1 million to do the study.
If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national 
campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start 
immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. 
nationwide to garner support for the project.

Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile.  Appreciate your 
comments.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Red Herring Article


Jeff,

I was recently skimming the Enron news articles on Yahoo Finance and saw this 
one published in Red Herring about the sad demise of the renewable energy 
business in California:

http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&doc_id=1040018104&channel=100
00001

I thought the article was reasonable until I got to a certain part about the 
impact that recent high prices have had on these companies and Enron was 
mentioned in a rather improper light, in my opinion.  Below is a short 
excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning 
Enron:

"Proponents of renewable power viewed California's deregulation as flawed 
from the onset three years ago. Still, they anticipated that with adequate 
publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the 
traditional power supply, which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil 
fuels and nuclear power, and that the demand would spur supply. The number of 
producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow -- 
as long as the big utilities didn't interfere.

That's what almost happened. Over the last three years, retailers like Green 
Mountain Energy and Utility.com bought green power already available in 
California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy 
generators, like windmill farms and large solar-panel assemblies. Still, for 
all the optimism and effort, only about 200,000 customers -- less than 1 
percent of the 8.5 million households that had the option of switching 
providers -- chose to support them. Many of those were swayed by a 
deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who 
switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented 
a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a 
penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an 
average monthly surcharge of $5.

Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy 
wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a 
rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt 
hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy 
power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a 
price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green 
consumers' bills more than doubled."

In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring 
this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that 
Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by 
supply and demand.  The average person reading this could very easily come to 
the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy 
companies, which is clearly not the case.  Nonetheless, thought you might 
find this of interest.

The memo going out on Monday discusses the corporate policy committee briefly 
at the end.  The corporate policy committee does the MD PRC (evaluation of 
MDs and promotions to MD), reviews the recommendations of the other 
committees (which we are just now forming).  Additionally, the corporate 
policy committee met to determine the membership and charters of the other 
committees (including the PRC committees).  The corporate policy committee is 
comprised of the most senior executives, including the Office of the 
Chairman, the leaders of the four business units and the heads of the 
corporate functions.  In addition to the specific items mentioned above, the 
corporate policy committee was intended to discuss and resolve the major 
issues facing the company, including issues of strategy, personnel and 
challenges facing the company.  

The corporate policy committee has met three times so far, so not much 
history yet.  Perhaps as further pronouncements issue from this august body, 
we will make more of a point about where they came from.

Davis favors tiered rate increases 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Sunday, March 25, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL:

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money," said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. "We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, "were wildly high." 
"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
" Maviglio said. "Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything." 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall," 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. "Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large." 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
"I don't like either choice," said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. "But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts." 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within "the existing rate structure" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
"For the good of California, it's inevitable," said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
"It's like gasoline," he said. "I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business." 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it," said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. "But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts." 
"I'd rather have blackouts," agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. "I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher." 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation," said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
"It adjusts consumer behavior," Higgins said. "People want to get their bills 
back down." 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this," 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals," said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "We 
need to get back to a regulated system." 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
"We've paid too much already," Rosenfield said. "A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease." 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
"Big users should pay more," he said after a moment's reflection. "I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair." 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," she said. "People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more." 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. "That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability," she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

Steve, 

Sorry for the delay in tracking down this rumor on a potential ad campaign.
I left a message with Maureen this afternoon and subsequently talked with
Smith's staff person.  She said she was not aware of any ad campaign but she
would talk with the Senator about it when he is back on Monday. 

Have a good weekend and I will call you on Monday.

Rob,
After reviewing both Lauren's and Jeff's comments, I have little to add.  I 
would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first 
paragraph with "and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at 
strategies for reducing CO2  emissions more broadly, in ways that make 
economic and environmental sense" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol 
directly.
And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct 
employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report 
and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and 
communicate their thoughts.
Thanks,
Catherine

		 Subject: Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy


(KEELER EDITS)
Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann's eBiz request.  Comments welcome


"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to 
support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power 
plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy.   His decision was 
based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are 
experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate 
could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be 
ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas 
emissions is unworkable in its current form.  

"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration 
would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the 
long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative "anti-environment" 
reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations.  Because this is an 
important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the 
administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global 
climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts 
of action regulate CO2 emissions."

"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a 
private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market.  We are well-positioned 
through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural 
gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and 
tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron 
Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions 
trading and risk management."

"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of 
sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint.  Enron will 
continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring 
a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to 
build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and 
tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to 
make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way.  If we're able to make 
meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it 
in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on 
CO2 whether it is regulated or not."

In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to 
position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an 
industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy 
and environmental problems.

Hi Mr. Lay,

I am a Specialist in Corp. PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal 
eBiz publication.  I am working on a story about the recent issue with 
respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to 
President Bush's as well as the coal industry.  

I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide 
emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his 
decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns 
that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to 
natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher 
electricity prices causing problems similar to California.   

I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees.  A 
quote from you about this issue would be great.  I would also be interested 
in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling 
CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2.

Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
 Ann Schmidt

infinitely better because of Wade's involvement.  It was a team effort, but 
you should know that Jimmy Mogal also was very involved.  Of course, Wade 
wants to avoid damaging the company and your note helps to keep him up for

		 Subject: Greening the Enron Building Mtg

Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune 
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a 
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for 
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities 
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them 
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let 
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending 
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any 
"headroom" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in 
order for the "greening" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be 
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, 
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings 
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost 
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the 
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the 
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max 
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of 
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to 
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the 
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs 
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for 
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change 
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take 
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and 
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on 
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the "best" press for 
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that 
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our 
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100% green 
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company 
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks 
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy 
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, 
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the progress.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

Steve . . . 

FYI -- we conducted a post-event survey on opinions about the HR employee 
meeting held last month and the HR management team thought you should know 
that participants rated your presentation very high.

When asked what should be kept the same next time, participants commented as 
follows about your presentation:
"I think a presentation from Corporate HR is of great value."
"Keep the presentations by the officers . . . to talk about the business."
"I liked having other people from ETS/Enron there to better understand the 
big picture and where Enron is going."
"Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate 
activities. I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field 
staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management."
"Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton. Their perspectives are very good . . ."

Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we 
appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share 
information. 

You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again!

Regards, - Roger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks so much for your message.  Your communications are always complete, 
firm, clear and polite.  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of 
your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.  I understand 
from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you 
from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.  I have asked John to 
lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very 
experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London 
office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked 
him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the 
area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of 
Enron's corporate security needs.  A little background I'll bore you with:  
after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not 
replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security 
and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate 
function to a "default provider" role -- if a business unit had a need it was 
not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) 
would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization 
of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had 
assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding 
India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It 
was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already 
addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work 
involved implementation.  John volunteered to send some people over to help 
and I said OK.  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike 
Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).

The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying 
"we're from corporate and we're here to help".  If you don't need any "help" 
or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me 
know.

Subject: India Help

Steve,

As you are well aware, we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India. 
We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I 
want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security.

1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the 
quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an 
outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we 
had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim 
to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 
hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew 
Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time 
Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have 
been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and 
Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared 
now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, 
and Drew had his team there for us.

2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and 
supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team 
on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with 
Houston. Great efforts and productive work.

3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback 
on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don't have 
any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups 
headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed 
us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently 
travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling 
me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our 
security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him 
to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people 
over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but 
I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If 
you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate 
with that person.

On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in 
through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of 
whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work 
day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he 
would come.

At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on 
security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I 
asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done 
a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been 
overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey 
yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them 
through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from 
the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a 
complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from 
servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for 
all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony 
Duenner of EBS Asia.

Again, we appreciate all the help. 

Wade

Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Note Tim's question about handicapping 
the liklihood of approval.  Prices will move in the West based on these 
odds.  We need to have a better view than anyone else.

Subject: Re: ISO Market Stabilization Plan  

Tim,  although there's always a "chance" my impression is that the FERC won't 
buy the ban on exports, as this would appear to run afoul of the Commerce 
Clause and certainly goes counter to everything that FERC hopes to accomplish 
with their own Order 888 and 2000 initiatives.  I am less certain about the 
direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized 
stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants.  

The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is 
unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term.  If 
they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include 
the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this 
"fast" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in 
court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending 
entirely on the circumstances.

Will keep you posted if I learn anything new on this.  Ray

Subject: ISO Market Stabilization Plan

The recent plan filed at FERC is horrible.  The two most aggregious parts are 
the cost based standing bids and the ban on exports.  I know that we are 
commenting on this proposal.  I am also looking for intellegence on whether 
the ISO proposal has any chance of getting approved by FERC.  If it is not 
approved by FERC, what can the Californians do?  California has ignored FERC 
before.  If they attempt to unilaterally implement changes what is the 
likelihood that the Feds step in to intervene?  If you hear anything on this 
matter please keep me posted.  The proposed plan will have a huge impact on 
the California market and we need as much advance notice as possible.

Mark,

Congratulations on your new assignment.  It has been a long time since I have 
dealt with Coal but the business desperately needed new ideas and approaches 
when I knew it.  Good luck!

Yes, I did meet with JoAnn last Friday.  As required by the agreement she 
gave me, I have retained counsel and the proposal is being reviewed by my 
attorney.  In light of the announced change, I am wondering if questions and 
comments should still be addressed to you?  Please advise.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Enron is a member of the Texas eCommerce Association and they asked if we 
would provide a panelist this Thursday night the 3rd for the Texas 
deregulation panel.  

First, do you want anyone from your organization answering questions about 
Texas deregulation on this or any panel?  If it is OK with you if this sort 
of thing is done, who would the person be from your organization and can they 
do it next Thursday?

Sorry about the short notice, I just found out today.  I have not agreed to 
anyone, I said I would talk to you and try.

Your thoughts?

Greg,
I just talked to Gary and he said you guys had a terrific meeting.
We are so glad to have Enron as a Cornerstone Member and look forward to 
working with you as one of our Advisory Board members.
As Gary mentioned, we are having our Houston ePanel on Thursday, May 3.  
Thanks so much for working on getting us the right person from Enron to be a 
panelist.  The details of the event are as follows:
----------------------------------------------------
5.3.01 ePanel!
eEnergy:  Evolving Trends in the Deregulation of the Electric Industry
The U.S. electric industry is undergoing a sea change in the way it delivers 
electricity to millions of households and businesses nationwide. The $220 
billion industry, which has been called the last great government-sanctioned 
monopoly, is slowly but surely being deregulated and opened to competition, 
giving consumers the power to choose their electricity provider in much the 
same way they choose telephone carriers.
Deregulation, now scheduled to occur on January 1, 2002, is coming to Texas 
and with it comes the power of choice for most Texans. Just like you can 
choose your phone or cable provider, you will soon be able to choose your 
electric provider. 
Panelists include:
Waters Davis, President, Reliant Energy Retail Services
Brett Perlman, Commissioner, Public Utilities Commission of Texas
Time:
4:45 ) 5:15 Private reception ) panelists, Texas eComm Members and media
5:30 ) 6:00 Check-In
6:00 ) 7:15 ePanel Discussion
7:15 -          Networking
----------------------------------------------------
Also, We were planning on hosting this event at Dynegy, however they are 
unable to accommodate our request due to scheduling conflicts that were 
unforseen.  We were hoping that Enron would consider hosting the event and 
allow us to use your auditorium in light of this new development.  Please let 
me know if this is a possibility.  Thanks for your consideration.

Subject: Some comments on the brief
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I forgot to email myself the brief to track changes, but here are my changes 
in writing:

p. 1:  Para starting "focusing on the latter," that sentence, change "get 
creative" to be innavotaive in its approach."

p. 2:  1st full Paragraph, Second sentence, change "uniting" to "common" and 
there is a typo on line5, reduction n consumption.   Should be "of"

page 6:  We need the RR for PG&E.

Under Part VII, Rate Design, can we insert a sentence that our proposal, 
unlike the others, does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period.  We 
told Scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times 
in the brief.

We also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices, 
as a 3:2 ratio, which is not what other parties have proposed.

page 8:  2.  Derivation of Threshold Usage:, first sentence, delete "between" 
in first sentence.

page 9:  Second full paragraph, begining "Again, the UDS's, "  Second 
sentence, sited should be "cited"

p. 12:  First full paragraph beginning "A primary component,"  Insert a 
sentence after the second sentence to mention, again, the arbitrariness of 
proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak.

 Second full parag, beginning, "Enron's proposal, can stick a sentence about 
arbitrariness in there too.  And change "more necessary goal" in 4th sentence 
to "more critical goal"

I don't have the email I sent out about what we agreed to insert with Scott, 
so if you have a chance, check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to.

I am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check 
email again, but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in 
Houston at 9:20 am tomorrow, and that is where I will be when you have the 
9:30 call (we made this appointment months ago).  But I will communicate with 
Harry and everyone else before then.  Thanks.

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: "The
agenda will include "unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power."
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases.  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel.  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available to
participate in a conference call.  Thanks/

Subject: Barton Bill

You seemed troubled by the call to Barton.  This bill may or may not be 
subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this 
summer.  Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path 
ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise.  The call to 
Barton was to:  a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal 
calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) 
proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not 
done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more 
input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this 
will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit 
for the defeat of price caps.  I hear from lots of DC sources that we have 
not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Numerous 
folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's 
first real role in the Committee.  Thus, even though this is a very limited 
bill, the call made sense.  I do not think that this means we should call the 
White House to push the bill with them.  The bill itself still has lots of 
obstacles and many potential threats ahead.

Subject: USG overtures on Dabhol

Rebecca
 At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya, another of our problem projects, 
Dabhol was raised.  A representative from the White House transition team 
joined the conversation.  I was asked the terms under which we were prepared 
to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian 
authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with 
the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB.  I made 
clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a 
discussion.
 I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian 
Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes 
of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM 
it is supporting the move towards PNT.  The administration may be concerned 
that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded 
that the USG has politically taken a position on the project.
 In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the 
Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment 
concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the 
four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program 
moves forward.
 So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian 
ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the 
rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project.
 I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be 
helpful.  Thanks John

Subject: part time/reduced hour employees



Cindy I chatted with Elyse (Elizabeth Labanowski never returned my calls or 
messages) on the pt/rh issue.   Elyse is in favor of having the pt/rh 
employees in the regular PRC process, with education for managers and at 
facilitator training and a statement in the ground rules to ensure that they 
are not penalized or otherwise disadvantaged by the process.  

David and I discussed this option which he is in favor of it as well.  In the 
meantime for year end we will be ready with a system change to allow us to 
see pt/rh employees on the screen segregated from the full timers- and to 
have a live chart of pt/rh employees as well as the full timers.  We can't do 
that for mid-year because it requires a good deal of programming, but it is a 
feature we can incorporate at year end.  

what do you think?

Several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options.  
Specifically, they want to know what the exercise policy is on i) termination 
eg as a result of the prc process, ii) voluntary departure, iii) retirement, 
or iv)resignation; and to what extent do the rules vary across plans: i) 
AESOP, LTIP, deferred bonus etc.  The main focus is on the length of time to 
exercise.  I am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the 
structure -- eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than 
employees who just leave voluntarily ( ie if you want to have a full three 
years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and 
getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company?

Hi Steve.  I know you are extremely busy  but I was just  wondering if you 
found out about whether the 3 year period apllies to all  options or just the 
ones in that program.  Question 2)  does the 3 year time frame apply to only 
options that are vested at the time of departure or does it apply also to 
options which vest over the 3 year time frame.  I look forward to hearing 
from you.  Thank you.

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, July 4, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/04/M
N186091.DTL 
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal 
regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly 
imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of 
blackouts in the two states. 
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling 
blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling 
blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and 
reduce air conditioning. 
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a 
closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions 
that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during 
shortages. 
"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the 
California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of 
dollars to keep the state's lights on. 
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said. 
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet 
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates 
during periods of high demand. 
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the 
expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that 
electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. 
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said 
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
energy-industry association in Menlo Park. 
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no 
economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls 
are in effect. 
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not 
having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts." 
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when 
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert 
about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. 
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, a 
spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees 
the state's power network. 
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after 
Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting 
heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their 
lights. 
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that 
the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they 
are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in 
exacerbating Monday's shortage. 
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential 
for unintended consequences." 
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- 
efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, 
under capped prices. 
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said. 
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 
per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of 
the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101. 
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have 
extended California's power crisis to neighboring states. 
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said. 
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES' 
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith 
that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal 
regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot 
withhold output. 
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," 
said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources. 
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue 
that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal 
regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply 
and demand determine costs. 
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back 
on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001) 
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, 
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state 
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said. 
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Stage 
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the first 
time since they went into effect June 21. 
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the 
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of 
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for 
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity for 
the state's financially distressed utilities. 
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusion 
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear." 
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced 
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. 
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada. 
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a 
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power 
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting 
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. 
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap 
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages. 
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell, 
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind of 
certainty at all." 
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute imports 
from the Bonne'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets 
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state 
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts are 
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon. 
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8. 
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The 
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient 
plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the 
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. 
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was 
established during the latest alert. 
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour in 
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early 
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said. 
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many 
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew 
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO. 
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $98 
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent 
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a credit 
risk in selling to the state. 
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every 
time the ISO declares a power alert. 
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. But 
out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the 
out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs 
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to 
sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it. 

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 

?????SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted 
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday 
afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
?????The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to 
supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the 
California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the 
state's electricity since January.
?????At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us 
that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going 
to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
?????The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in 
summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, 
meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since 
May 31.
?????Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power 
emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that 
applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona. 
?????The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the 
most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California 
grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
?????But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is 
supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparently 
drove away sellers, Hart said.
?????Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting 
the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that had 
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon 
backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of 
Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of 
the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
?????Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare a 
Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy 
commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and 
when it should take effect. They got no answer.
?????Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to 
clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power 
suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
?????Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when it 
is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price 
of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped lately.
?????Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators 
had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in 
part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had 
agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower 
each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this 
summer.
?????"Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said.

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer 
Wednesday, July 4, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/04/MN186091.DTL  
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states. 
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning. 
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. 
"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on. 
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said. 
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand. 
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. 
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park. 
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect. 
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts." 
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. 
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network. 
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights. 
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage. 
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences." 
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices. 
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said. 
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101. 
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states. 
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said. 
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES' 
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output. 
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources. 
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs. 
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies. 
"No one answered," he said. "They were closed." 
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls

Please provide Ray Alvarez your comments.  This would be filed as early as Monday am.

Subject:	Re: NEW DRAFT OF ENRON STATEMENT   

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

Dear Jeff,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington, DC on October 3-4.  Ordinarily, I would be happy to
participate.  However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on
October 1.  Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.
Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.  Too bad.

On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me?  I would like to set something up with MIT's
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including
energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

Thanks

Paul

Subject: Enron's PaineWebber Service

Rocky Emery, the Dowd family, Kim Bowden, and another 15 or so employees of 
UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options, restricted stock, etc) 
left yesterday evening without any warning.  They went to 1st Union.

I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure 
they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will 
not be affected.

I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the 
affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.  Also, I'm 
going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the 
following list:  (in case this happens again, we'll have a solid back-up 
immediately)

UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider)
1st Union (where Rocky Emery went)
Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology 
standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before)
Prudential (another option with internal connections)

let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Aaron

Subject: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy

Steve-

We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library 
Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 
1998 totaling $250K over five years.

I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the 
latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage 
for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts.

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of 
program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like.  We have discussed 
an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the 
likes.

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley.  
Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or 
lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort.  Rob has already been 
participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded 
efforts.

What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by 
CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the 
Library Center or School of Public Policy.

Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time.

Thanks.

Mike

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly

Attached are some late night thoughts on the portal.  Most of this is 
focussed on the portal for opinion leaders, but some of it could be 
applicable to the comemrcial portal as well.

Could you forward this to Palmer ... for some reason my address book doesn't 
pull him up when I'm off the system.

Subject:	Management Conference - Save the Date


Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic "Save the Date" memo for the Management Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.

No.  We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.  Thanks
