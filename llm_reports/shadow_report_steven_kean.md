### 1. Subject Profile: `steven.kean@enron.com`

*   **Role & Responsibilities:** Based on the dossier, Steven Kean is a senior executive whose responsibilities span Public Affairs, Government Affairs, Environmental Affairs, Regulatory Affairs, and Corporate Communications. He acts as a key strategist and message crafter for the company, particularly on high-stakes regulatory and political issues. He is involved in shaping the company's public narrative on complex topics like energy deregulation and high prices (`<31654493.1075846303984.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`), managing relationships with government agencies and political figures (`<31120972.1075846307507.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`), and serving as a senior advisor to top leadership, including the CEO and Chairman (`<19485991.1075843405457.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`). He also appears to have a role in high-level corporate strategy and organizational design, as evidenced by his work with McKinsey on a "professional partnership model" (`<11621851.1075846195131.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`).

*   **Network Position:** Kean operates as a **Gatekeeper** and **Senior Strategist**. He is a central node in the information flow between operational/legal teams and the highest levels of executive leadership (Lay and Skilling). He filters information, shapes strategy, and directs subordinates on how to engage with external parties. His approval is sought on external communications (`<17278396.1075847635719.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`), and he is included in critical meetings with top executives (`<28148743.1075846307461.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`).

*   **Key Correspondents:**
    1.  **Jeff Dasovich:** A key subordinate and implementer, particularly focused on the California energy crisis. Kean provides direction and strategic guidance to Dasovich.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<33259047.1075846217596.JavaMail.evans@thyme>` - Kean asks Dasovich if a California Senator is looking for a "public hanging" and expresses his belief that presenting "the facts" will change minds.

### 2. Operational Baseline & Context

*   **Normal vs. Abnormal:** All communications in this dossier were sent during the "Dead Zone" (nights or weekends). For a senior executive in a high-stakes, global company, working outside of standard business hours is not inherently abnormal. However, the consistent pattern suggests a perpetually high-pressure environment where critical strategy and communications are handled "off the clock." This could be to avoid the interruptions of the business day or to communicate when external observation is less likely. The tone is consistently professional and direct, but the subject matter frequently involves managing crises, shaping narratives, and navigating complex political and regulatory challenges.

*   **The Narrative Arc:** The dossier begins in late 2000 with Kean managing routine high-level corporate affairs, such as keynote speech messaging, university relations, and lobbying efforts. The narrative quickly pivots and becomes overwhelmingly dominated by the escalating California energy crisis. The emails from late 2000 through mid-2001 show an intense, multi-front effort to manage the political, regulatory, and public relations fallout from the crisis. This includes analyzing the financial viability of California utilities, drafting legal and regulatory filings, shaping talking points for analysts, and attempting to influence policymakers. The dossier ends with Enron deeply enmeshed in legal and regulatory battles in California, trying to defend its position while simultaneously managing other global political risks (e.g., Dabhol in India).

### 3. Forensic Risk Assessment (The Anomaly Radar)

*   **A. Financial & Accounting Anomalies:**
    *   **Finding:** There is an expressed concern about a lack of transparency in a deal structure involving Enron's interest in a company (FCEL). A senior executive, David Delainey, forwards a plan to Kean that requires careful management of disclosures to regulators.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<16075660.1075846233196.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "fyi - there has been some concern that this deal was being put together without Connecticut authorities knowing the full extent of our interest in FCEL." Delainey's forwarded message states, "any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in FCEL." The need to explicitly script full disclosure suggests the default might be otherwise.

*   **B. Information Control & Secrecy:**
    *   **Finding:** An executive lays out a plan for a transaction that must be managed "as per the script," indicating a carefully controlled narrative for external parties, including regulators.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<16075660.1075846233196.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner."
    *   **Finding:** A draft letter from Enron's outside counsel to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) details a strategy of delaying data production while acknowledging that the CPUC perceives this as non-cooperation and intends to "punish" such entities. This demonstrates a deliberate strategy of withholding information from a regulator.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<31445169.1075846324819.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "...EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's threatened motion to compel before FERC." and "We understand that the Commission intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas."

*   **C. Regulatory Gaming & Market Manipulation:**
    *   **Finding:** The company successfully "orchestrated" pressure from Congress and the Administration to force federal agencies (BLM/USFS) to back down from costly policies. This is a clear admission of leveraging political power to achieve a specific, favorable regulatory outcome.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<31120972.1075846307507.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away..." and "The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate."
    *   **Finding:** Kean discusses receiving information from a FERC staffer ("Larcamp") about a potential loophole in impending price caps, noting that the caps might not apply to bilateral transactions. This suggests an awareness and willingness to exploit regulatory loopholes.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<4941088.1075846216360.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO -- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements. He asked if knowing this would change any of our views..."
    *   **Finding:** Kean suggests leaking information to legislators from a lawsuit where the plaintiff's own expert consulting firm allegedly quit because their analysis did not support the claims of market manipulation. This is an attempt to use privileged legal information to politically undermine opponents.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<18051776.1075848008922.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "I think we should let people in the legislature know about this and see if one or more of them can get their hands on it."

*   **D. Conflicts of Interest & Ethics:**
    *   **Finding:** An Enron subsidiary (Azurix) loses a public contract award after political maneuvering by a competitor. Kean is asked to engage "good political consultants" to reverse the decision, indicating a willingness to use political influence rather than the formal procurement process to win contracts.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<9818045.1075846220235.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "It is not even clear what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may be pure politics... Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand Rapids?"
    *   **Finding:** An internal legal memo raises concerns about Enron Energy Services (EES), a "marketing affiliate," taking over facilities management for Enron's pipelines. The concern is that this could violate FERC standards of conduct requiring pipelines and their marketing affiliates to function independently.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<16770280.1075846324188.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate 'access' to transportation and shipper records... is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information... Thus, it seems to me that EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function for NNG, TW or NBPL."

*   **E. Psychological Markers:**
    *   **Finding:** Kean expresses a cynical view of the company's relationship with the broader business community, framing Enron as a disruptive force that cannot align with status-quo organizations.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<19485991.1075843405457.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating incumbents. Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us."
    *   **Finding:** During the height of the California crisis, Kean gives an aggressive directive on a legal filing: "Take the gloves off." This indicates a shift to a more combative and less conciliatory posture.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<5476015.1075849869763.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "My suggestions are attached. Take the gloves off."

*   **F. Other Significant Anomalies:**
    *   **Finding:** An Indian customs office is investigating whether Enron's offshore production is subject to import duties, a claim Enron believes has "no merit." The company is taking the issue "very seriously" and mobilizing a high-level legal and governmental affairs response, suggesting a significant financial risk and a potentially difficult foreign government relationship.
        *   `EVIDENCE ID`: `<20784580.1075847802343.JavaMail.evans@thyme>`
        *   `Quote`: "...they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the crude we sell in India is subject to a 10-12% customs duty since it is produced outside of the 12 mile territorial limit."
